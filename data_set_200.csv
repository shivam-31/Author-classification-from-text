austen,romance,"[emma by jane austen 1816] volum i chapter i emma woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfort home and happi disposition, seem to unit some of the best bless of existence; and had live near twenty-on year in the world with veri littl to distress or vex her. she was the youngest of the two daughter of a most affectionate, indulg father; and had, in consequ of her sister marriage, been mistress of his hous from a veri earli period. her mother had die too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembr of her caresses; and her place had been suppli by an excel woman as governess, who had fallen littl short of a mother in affection. sixteen year had miss taylor been in mr. woodhous family, less as a gover than a friend, veri fond of both daughters, but particular of emma. between _them_"
austen,romance,"it was more the intimaci of sisters. even befor miss taylor had ceas to hold the nomin offic of governess, the mild of her temper had hard allow her to impos ani restraint; and the shadow of author be now long pass away, they had been live togeth as friend and friend veri mutual attached, and emma do just what she liked; high esteem miss taylor judgment, but direct chiefli by her own. the real evils, indeed, of emma situat were the power of have rather too much her own way, and a disposit to think a littl too well of herself; these were the disadvantag which threaten alloy to her mani enjoyments. the danger, however, was at present so unperceived, that they did not by ani mean rank as misfortun with her. sorrow came--a gentl sorrow--but not at all in the shape of ani disagre consciousness.--miss taylor married. it"
austen,romance,"was miss taylor loss which first brought grief. it was on the wedding-day of this belov friend that emma first sat in mourn thought of ani continuance. the wed over, and the bride-peopl gone, her father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening. her father compos himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then onli to sit and think of what she had lost. the event had everi promis of happi for her friend. mr. weston was a man of unexception character, easi fortune, suitabl age, and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfact in consid with what self-denying, generous friendship she had alway wish and promot the match; but it was a black morn work for her. the want of miss taylor would be felt everi hour of everi day. she recal her past kindness--th"
austen,romance,"kindness, the affect of sixteen years--how she had taught and how she had play with her from five year old--how she had devot all her power to attach and amus her in health--and how nurs her through the various ill of childhood. a larg debt of gratitud was owe here; but the intercours of the last seven years, the equal foot and perfect unreserv which had soon follow isabella marriage, on their be left to each other, was yet a dearer, tender recollection. she had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, know all the way of the family, interest in all it concerns, and peculiar interest in herself, in everi pleasure, everi scheme of hers--on to whom she could speak everi thought as it arose, and who had such an affect for her as could never find fault. how was she to bear"
austen,romance,"the change?--it was true that her friend was go onli half a mile from them; but emma was awar that great must be the differ between a mrs. weston, onli half a mile from them, and a miss taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natur and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffer from intellectu solitude. she dear love her father, but he was no companion for her. he could not meet her in conversation, ration or playful. the evil of the actual dispar in their age (and mr. woodhous had not marri early) was much increas by his constitut and habits; for have been a valetudinarian all his life, without activ of mind or body, he was a much older man in way than in years; and though everywher belov for the friendli of his heart and his amiabl temper, his talent could not"
austen,romance,"have recommend him at ani time. her sister, though compar but littl remov by matrimony, be settl in london, onli sixteen mile off, was much beyond her daili reach; and mani a long octob and novemb even must be struggl through at hartfield, befor christma brought the next visit from isabella and her husband, and their littl children, to fill the house, and give her pleasant societi again. highbury, the larg and popul village, almost amount to a town, to which hartfield, in spite of it separ lawn, and shrubberies, and name, did realli belong, afford her no equals. the woodhous were first in consequ there. all look up to them. she had mani acquaint in the place, for her father was univers civil, but not one among them who could be accept in lieu of miss taylor for even half a day. it was a melancholi change; and emma"
austen,romance,"could not but sigh over it, and wish for imposs things, till her father awoke, and made it necessari to be cheerful. his spirit requir support. he was a nervous man, easili depressed; fond of everi bodi that he was use to, and hate to part with them; hate chang of everi kind. matrimony, as the origin of change, was alway disagreeable; and he was by no mean yet reconcil to his own daughter marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entir a match of affection, when he was now oblig to part with miss taylor too; and from his habit of gentl selfishness, and of be never abl to suppos that other peopl could feel differ from himself, he was veri much dispos to think miss taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been"
austen,romance,"a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at hartfield. emma smile and chat as cheer as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was imposs for him not to say exact as he had said at dinner, ""poor miss taylor!--i wish she were here again. what a piti it is that mr. weston ever thought of her!"" ""i cannot agre with you, papa; you know i cannot. mr. weston is such a good-humoured, pleasant, excel man, that he thorough deserv a good wife;--and you would not have had miss taylor live with us for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a hous of her own?"" ""a hous of her own!--but where is the advantag of a hous of her own? this is three time as large.--and you have never ani odd humours,"
austen,romance,"my dear."" ""how often we shall be go to see them, and they come to see us!--w shall be alway meeting! _we_ must begin; we must go and pay wed visit veri soon."" ""mi dear, how am i to get so far? randal is such a distance. i could not walk half so far."" ""no, papa, nobodi thought of your walking. we must go in the carriage, to be sure."" ""the carriage! but jame will not like to put the hors to for such a littl way;--and where are the poor hors to be while we are pay our visit?"" ""they are to be put into mr. weston stable, papa. you know we have settl all that already. we talk it all over with mr. weston last night. and as for james, you may be veri sure he will alway like go to randalls, becaus of his daughter be housemaid"
austen,romance,"there. i onli doubt whether he will ever take us anywher else. that was your doing, papa. you got hannah that good place. nobodi thought of hannah till you mention her--jam is so oblig to you!"" ""i am veri glad i did think of her. it was veri lucky, for i would not have had poor jame think himself slight upon ani account; and i am sure she will make a veri good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken girl; i have a great opinion of her. whenev i see her, she alway curtsey and ask me how i do, in a veri pretti manner; and when you have had her here to do needlework, i observ she alway turn the lock of the door the right way and never bang it. i am sure she will be an excel servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor"
austen,romance,"miss taylor to have somebodi about her that she is use to see. whenev jame goe over to see his daughter, you know, she will be hear of us. he will be abl to tell her how we all are."" emma spare no exert to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father toler through the evening, and be attack by no regret but her own. the backgammon-t was placed; but a visitor immedi afterward walk in and made it unnecessary. mr. knightley, a sensibl man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not onli a veri old and intim friend of the family, but particular connect with it, as the elder brother of isabella husband. he live about a mile from highbury, was a frequent visitor, and alway welcome, and at this time more welcom than usual, as come direct from their"
austen,romance,"mutual connexion in london. he had return to a late dinner, after some day absence, and now walk up to hartfield to say that all were well in brunswick square. it was a happi circumstance, and anim mr. woodhous for some time. mr. knightley had a cheer manner, which alway did him good; and his mani inquiri after ""poor isabella"" and her children were answer most satisfactorily. when this was over, mr. woodhous grate observed, ""it is veri kind of you, mr. knightley, to come out at this late hour to call upon us. i am afraid you must have had a shock walk."" ""not at all, sir. it is a beauti moonlight night; and so mild that i must draw back from your great fire."" ""but you must have found it veri damp and dirty. i wish you may not catch cold."" ""dirty, sir! look at my shoes. not"
austen,romance,"a speck on them."" ""well! that is quit surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain here. it rain dread hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast. i want them to put off the wedding."" ""bi the bye--i have not wish you joy. be pretti well awar of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, i have been in no hurri with my congratulations; but i hope it all went off toler well. how did you all behave? who cri most?"" ""ah! poor miss taylor! tis a sad business."" ""poor mr. and miss woodhouse, if you please; but i cannot possibl say `poor miss taylor. i have a great regard for you and emma; but when it come to the question of depend or independence!--at ani rate, it must be better to have onli one to pleas than two."" ""especi when _one_ of"
austen,romance,"those two is such a fanciful, troublesom creature!"" said emma playfully. ""that is what you have in your head, i know--and what you would certain say if my father were not by."" ""i believ it is veri true, my dear, indeed,"" said mr. woodhouse, with a sigh. ""i am afraid i am sometim veri fanci and troublesome."" ""mi dearest papa! you do not think i could mean _you_, or suppos mr. knightley to mean _you_. what a horribl idea! oh no! i meant onli myself. mr. knightley love to find fault with me, you know-- in a joke--it is all a joke. we alway say what we like to one another."" mr. knightley, in fact, was one of the few peopl who could see fault in emma woodhouse, and the onli one who ever told her of them: and though this was not particular agreeabl to emma herself, she knew"
austen,romance,"it would be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him realli suspect such a circumst as her not be thought perfect by everi body. ""emma know i never flatter her,"" said mr. knightley, ""but i meant no reflect on ani body. miss taylor has been use to have two person to please; she will now have but one. the chanc are that she must be a gainer."" ""well,"" said emma, will to let it pass--""you want to hear about the wedding; and i shall be happi to tell you, for we all behav charmingly. everi bodi was punctual, everi bodi in their best looks: not a tear, and hard a long face to be seen. oh no; we all felt that we were go to be onli half a mile apart, and were sure of meet everi day."" ""dear emma bear everi thing so"
austen,romance,"well,"" said her father. ""but, mr. knightley, she is realli veri sorri to lose poor miss taylor, and i am sure she _will_ miss her more than she think for."" emma turn away her head, divid between tear and smiles. ""it is imposs that emma should not miss such a companion,"" said mr. knightley. ""we should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could suppos it; but she know how much the marriag is to miss taylor advantage; she know how veri accept it must be, at miss taylor time of life, to be settl in a home of her own, and how import to her to be secur of a comfort provision, and therefor cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. everi friend of miss taylor must be glad to have her so happili married."" ""and you have forgotten one matter of"
austen,romance,"joy to me,"" said emma, ""and a veri consider one--that i made the match myself. i made the match, you know, four year ago; and to have it take place, and be prove in the right, when so mani peopl said mr. weston would never marri again, may comfort me for ani thing."" mr. knightley shook his head at her. her father fond replied, ""ah! my dear, i wish you would not make match and foretel things, for whatev you say alway come to pass. pray do not make ani more matches."" ""i promis you to make none for myself, papa; but i must, indeed, for other people. it is the greatest amus in the world! and after such success, you know!--everi bodi said that mr. weston would never marri again. oh dear, no! mr. weston, who had been a widow so long, and who seem so perfect comfort without"
austen,romance,"a wife, so constant occupi either in his busi in town or among his friend here, alway accept wherev he went, alway cheerful-- mr. weston need not spend a singl even in the year alon if he did not like it. oh no! mr. weston certain would never marri again. some peopl even talk of a promis to his wife on her deathbed, and other of the son and the uncl not let him. all manner of solemn nonsens was talk on the subject, but i believ none of it. ""ever sinc the day--about four year ago--that miss taylor and i met with him in broadway lane, when, becaus it began to drizzle, he dart away with so much gallantry, and borrow two umbrella for us from farmer mitchell's, i made up my mind on the subject. i plan the match from that hour; and when such success has bless"
austen,romance,"me in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that i shall leav off match-making."" ""i do not understand what you mean by `success,'"" said mr. knightley. ""success suppos endeavour. your time has been proper and delic spent, if you have been endeavour for the last four year to bring about this marriage. a worthi employ for a young ladi mind! but if, which i rather imagine, your make the match, as you call it, mean onli your plan it, your say to yourself one idl day, `i think it would be a veri good thing for miss taylor if mr. weston were to marri her, and say it again to yourself everi now and then afterwards, whi do you talk of success? where is your merit? what are you proud of? you made a lucki guess; and _that_ is all that can be said."" ""and have you never known"
austen,romance,"the pleasur and triumph of a lucki guess?-- i piti you.--i thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a lucki guess is never mere luck. there is alway some talent in it. and as to my poor word `success, which you quarrel with, i do not know that i am so entir without ani claim to it. you have drawn two pretti pictures; but i think there may be a third--a someth between the do-noth and the do-all. if i had not promot mr. weston visit here, and given mani littl encouragements, and smooth mani littl matters, it might not have come to ani thing after all. i think you must know hartfield enough to comprehend that."" ""a straightforward, open-heart man like weston, and a rational, unaffect woman like miss taylor, may be safe left to manag their own concerns. you are more like to have done harm to yourself, than"
austen,romance,"good to them, by interference."" ""emma never think of herself, if she can do good to others,"" rejoin mr. woodhouse, understand but in part. ""but, my dear, pray do not make ani more matches; they are silli things, and break up one famili circl grievously."" ""on one more, papa; onli for mr. elton. poor mr. elton! you like mr. elton, papa,--i must look about for a wife for him. there is nobodi in highburi who deserv him--and he has been here a whole year, and has fit up his hous so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have him singl ani longer--and i thought when he was join their hand to-day, he look so veri much as if he would like to have the same kind offic done for him! i think veri well of mr. elton, and this is the onli way i have of do him"
austen,romance,"a service."" ""mr. elton is a veri pretti young man, to be sure, and a veri good young man, and i have a great regard for him. but if you want to shew him ani attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day. that will be a much better thing. i dare say mr. knightley will be so kind as to meet him."" ""with a great deal of pleasure, sir, at ani time,"" said mr. knightley, laughing, ""and i agre with you entirely, that it will be a much better thing. invit him to dinner, emma, and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken, but leav him to chuse his own wife. depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenti can take care of himself."" chapter ii mr. weston was a nativ of highbury, and born of a respect family,"
austen,romance,"which for the last two or three generat had been rise into gentil and property. he had receiv a good education, but, on succeed earli in life to a small independence, had becom indispos for ani of the more home pursuit in which his brother were engaged, and had satisfi an active, cheer mind and social temper by enter into the militia of his county, then embodied. captain weston was a general favourite; and when the chanc of his militari life had introduc him to miss churchill, of a great yorkshir family, and miss churchil fell in love with him, nobodi was surprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend. miss churchill, however, be of age, and with the full command of her fortune--though her fortun bore no proport to the family-estate--wa not"
austen,romance,"to be dissuad from the marriage, and it took place, to the infinit mortif of mr. and mrs. churchill, who threw her off with due decorum. it was an unsuit connexion, and did not produc much happiness. mrs. weston ought to have found more in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think everi thing due to her in return for the great good of be in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. she had resolut enough to pursu her own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain from unreason regret at that brother unreason anger, nor from miss the luxuri of her former home. they live beyond their income, but still it was noth in comparison of enscombe: she did not ceas to love her husband, but she"
austen,romance,"want at onc to be the wife of captain weston, and miss churchil of enscombe. captain weston, who had been considered, especi by the churchills, as make such an amaz match, was prove to have much the worst of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three year marriage, he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain. from the expens of the child, however, he was soon relieved. the boy had, with the addit soften claim of a linger ill of his mother's, been the mean of a sort of reconciliation; and mr. and mrs. churchill, have no children of their own, nor ani other young creatur of equal kindr to care for, offer to take the whole charg of the littl frank soon after her decease. some scrupl and some reluct the widower-fath may be suppos to have felt; but"
austen,romance,"as they were overcom by other considerations, the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the churchills, and he had onli his own comfort to seek, and his own situat to improv as he could. a complet chang of life becam desirable. he quit the militia and engag in trade, have brother alreadi establish in a good way in london, which afford him a favour opening. it was a concern which brought just employ enough. he had still a small hous in highbury, where most of his leisur day were spent; and between use occup and the pleasur of society, the next eighteen or twenti year of his life pass cheer away. he had, by that time, realis an easi competence--enough to secur the purchas of a littl estat adjoin highbury, which he had alway long for--enough to marri a woman as portionless even as miss"
austen,romance,"taylor, and to live accord to the wish of his own friend and social disposition. it was now some time sinc miss taylor had begun to influenc his schemes; but as it was not the tyrann influenc of youth on youth, it had not shaken his determin of never settl till he could purchas randalls, and the sale of randal was long look forward to; but he had gone steadili on, with these object in view, till they were accomplished. he had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtain his wife; and was begin a new period of existence, with everi probabl of greater happi than in ani yet pass through. he had never been an unhappi man; his own temper had secur him from that, even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delight a well-judg and truli amiabl woman could be, and must"
austen,romance,"give him the pleasantest proof of it be a great deal better to choos than to be chosen, to excit gratitud than to feel it. he had onli himself to pleas in his choice: his fortun was his own; for as to frank, it was more than be tacit brought up as his uncl heir, it had becom so avow an adopt as to have him assum the name of churchil on come of age. it was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his father assistance. his father had no apprehens of it. the aunt was a caprici woman, and govern her husband entirely; but it was not in mr. weston natur to imagin that ani capric could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed, so deserv dear. he saw his son everi year in london, and was proud of him; and his"
austen,romance,"fond report of him as a veri fine young man had made highburi feel a sort of pride in him too. he was look on as suffici belong to the place to make his merit and prospect a kind of common concern. mr. frank churchil was one of the boast of highbury, and a live curios to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so littl return that he had never been there in his life. his come to visit his father had been often talk of but never achieved. now, upon his father marriage, it was veri general proposed, as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place. there was not a dissenti voic on the subject, either when mrs. perri drank tea with mrs. and miss bates, or when mrs. and miss bate return the visit. now was the time for mr. frank churchil to come"
austen,romance,"among them; and the hope strengthen when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion. for a few days, everi morn visit in highburi includ some mention of the handsom letter mrs. weston had received. ""i suppos you have heard of the handsom letter mr. frank churchil has written to mrs. weston? i understand it was a veri handsom letter, indeed. mr. woodhous told me of it. mr. woodhous saw the letter, and he say he never saw such a handsom letter in his life."" it was, indeed, a high prize letter. mrs. weston had, of course, form a veri favour idea of the young man; and such a pleas attent was an irresist proof of his great good sense, and a most welcom addit to everi sourc and everi express of congratul which her marriag had alreadi secured. she felt herself a most"
austen,romance,"fortun woman; and she had live long enough to know how fortun she might well be thought, where the onli regret was for a partial separ from friend whose friendship for her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her. she knew that at time she must be missed; and could not think, without pain, of emma lose a singl pleasure, or suffer an hour ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear emma was of no feebl character; she was more equal to her situat than most girl would have been, and had sense, and energy, and spirit that might be hope would bear her well and happili through it littl difficulti and privations. and then there was such comfort in the veri easi distanc of randal from hartfield, so conveni for even solitari femal walking, and in mr. weston disposit and circumstances, which"
austen,romance,"would make the approach season no hindranc to their spend half the even in the week together. her situat was altogeth the subject of hour of gratitud to mrs. weston, and of moment onli of regret; and her satisfaction--h more than satisfaction--h cheer enjoyment, was so just and so apparent, that emma, well as she knew her father, was sometim taken by surpriz at his be still abl to piti `poor miss taylor, when they left her at randal in the centr of everi domest comfort, or saw her go away in the even attend by her pleasant husband to a carriag of her own. but never did she go without mr. woodhous give a gentl sigh, and saying, ""ah, poor miss taylor! she would be veri glad to stay."" there was no recov miss taylor--nor much likelihood of ceas to piti her; but a few week brought some allevi"
austen,romance,"to mr. woodhouse. the compliment of his neighbour were over; he was no longer teas by be wish joy of so sorrow an event; and the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him, was all eat up. his own stomach could bear noth rich, and he could never believ other peopl to be differ from himself. what was unwholesom to him he regard as unfit for ani body; and he had, therefore, earnest tri to dissuad them from have ani wedding-cak at all, and when that prove vain, as earnest tri to prevent ani bodi eat it. he had been at the pain of consult mr. perry, the apothecary, on the subject. mr. perri was an intelligent, gentlemanlik man, whose frequent visit were one of the comfort of mr. woodhous life; and upon be appli to, he could not but acknowledg (though it seem rather against the bias"
austen,romance,"of inclination) that wedding-cak might certain disagre with many--perhap with most people, unless taken moderately. with such an opinion, in confirm of his own, mr. woodhous hope to influenc everi visitor of the newli marri pair; but still the cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevol nerv till it was all gone. there was a strang rumour in highburi of all the littl perri be seen with a slice of mrs. weston wedding-cak in their hands: but mr. woodhous would never believ it. chapter iii mr. woodhous was fond of societi in his own way. he like veri much to have his friend come and see him; and from various unit causes, from his long resid at hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the visit of his own littl circle, in a great measure, as he"
austen,romance,"liked. he had not much intercours with ani famili beyond that circle; his horror of late hours, and larg dinner-parties, made him unfit for ani acquaint but such as would visit him on his own terms. fortun for him, highbury, includ randal in the same parish, and donwel abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of mr. knightley, comprehend mani such. not unfrequently, through emma persuasion, he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but even parti were what he preferred; and, unless he fanci himself at ani time unequ to company, there was scarc an even in the week in which emma could not make up a card-tabl for him. real, long-stand regard brought the weston and mr. knightley; and by mr. elton, a young man live alon without like it, the privileg of exchang ani vacant even of his own blank solitud for"
austen,romance,"the eleg and societi of mr. woodhous drawing-room, and the smile of his love daughter, was in no danger of be thrown away. after these came a second set; among the most come-at- of whom were mrs. and miss bates, and mrs. goddard, three ladi almost alway at the servic of an invit from hartfield, and who were fetch and carri home so often, that mr. woodhous thought it no hardship for either jame or the horses. had it taken place onli onc a year, it would have been a grievance. mrs. bates, the widow of a former vicar of highbury, was a veri old lady, almost past everi thing but tea and quadrille. she live with her singl daughter in a veri small way, and was consid with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward circumstances, can excite. her daughter enjoy a most"
austen,romance,"uncommon degre of popular for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married. miss bate stood in the veri worst predica in the world for have much of the public favour; and she had no intellectu superior to make aton to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect. she had never boast either beauti or cleverness. her youth had pass without distinction, and her middl of life was devot to the care of a fail mother, and the endeavour to make a small incom go as far as possible. and yet she was a happi woman, and a woman whom no one name without good-will. it was her own univers good-wil and content temper which work such wonders. she love everi body, was interest in everi bodi happiness, quicksight to everi bodi merits; thought herself a most fortun creature, and surround with bless in such an"
austen,romance,"excel mother, and so mani good neighbour and friends, and a home that want for nothing. the simplic and cheer of her nature, her content and grate spirit, were a recommend to everi body, and a mine of felic to herself. she was a great talker upon littl matters, which exact suit mr. woodhouse, full of trivial communic and harmless gossip. mrs. goddard was the mistress of a school--not of a seminary, or an establishment, or ani thing which professed, in long sentenc of refin nonsense, to combin liber acquir with eleg morality, upon new principl and new systems--and where young ladi for enorm pay might be screw out of health and into vanity--but a real, honest, old-fashion boarding-school, where a reason quantiti of accomplish were sold at a reason price, and where girl might be sent to be out of the way, and scrambl themselv into a littl education,"

""yes, indeed, a veri good letter,"" repli emma rather slowly--""so good a letter, harriet, that everi thing considered, i think one of his sister must have help him. i can hard imagin the young man whom i saw talk with you the other day could express himself so well, if left quit to his own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman; no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffus enough for a woman. no doubt he is a sensibl man, and i suppos may have a natur talent for--think strong and clearly--and when he take a pen in hand, his thought natur find proper words. it is so with some men. yes, i understand the sort of mind. vigorous, decided, with sentiment to a certain point, not"

""you could not have visit me!"" she cried, look aghast. ""no, to be sure you could not; but i never thought of that before. that would have been too dreadful!--what an escape!--dear miss woodhouse, i would not give up the pleasur and honour of be intim with you for ani thing in the world.""

austen,romance,"gone, mr. knightley called, and sat some time with mr. woodhous and emma, till mr. woodhouse, who had previous made up his mind to walk out, was persuad by his daughter not to defer it, and was induc by the entreati of both, though against the scrupl of his own civility, to leav mr. knightley for that purpose. mr. knightley, who had noth of ceremoni about him, was offer by his short, decid answers, an amus contrast to the protract apolog and civil hesit of the other. ""well, i believe, if you will excus me, mr. knightley, if you will not consid me as do a veri rude thing, i shall take emma advic and go out for a quarter of an hour. as the sun is out, i believ i had better take my three turn while i can. i treat you without ceremony, mr. knightley. we invalid think"
austen,romance,"we are privileg people."" ""mi dear sir, do not make a stranger of me."" ""i leav an excel substitut in my daughter. emma will be happi to entertain you. and therefor i think i will beg your excus and take my three turns--mi winter walk."" ""you cannot do better, sir."" ""i would ask for the pleasur of your company, mr. knightley, but i am a veri slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides, you have anoth long walk befor you, to donwel abbey."" ""thank you, sir, thank you; i am go this moment myself; and i think the sooner _you_ go the better. i will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you."" mr. woodhous at last was off; but mr. knightley, instead of be immedi off likewise, sat down again, seem inclin for more chat. he began speak of harriet, and speak"
austen,romance,"of her with more voluntari prais than emma had ever heard before. ""i cannot rate her beauti as you do,"" said he; ""but she is a pretti littl creature, and i am inclin to think veri well of her disposition. her charact depend upon those she is with; but in good hand she will turn out a valuabl woman."" ""i am glad you think so; and the good hands, i hope, may not be wanting."" ""come,"" said he, ""you are anxious for a compliment, so i will tell you that you have improv her. you have cure her of her school-girl giggle; she realli doe you credit."" ""thank you. i should be mortifi inde if i did not believ i had been of some use; but it is not everi bodi who will bestow prais where they may. _you_ do not often overpow me with it."" ""you are expect her"

""highburi gossips!--tiresom wretches!"" ""harriet may not consid everi bodi tiresom that you would."" emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefor said nothing. he present added, with a smile, ""i do not pretend to fix on time or places, but i must tell you that i have good reason to believ your littl friend will soon hear of someth to her advantage."" ""indeed! how so? of what sort?"" ""a veri serious sort, i assur you;"" still smiling. ""veri serious! i can think of but one thing--who is in love with her? who make you their confidant?"" emma was more than half in hope of mr. elton have dropt a hint. mr. knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she"
austen,romance,"knew mr. elton look up to him. ""i have reason to think,"" he replied, ""that harriet smith will soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexception quarter:--robert martin is the man. her visit to abbey-mill, this summer, seem to have done his business. he is desper in love and mean to marri her."" ""he is veri obliging,"" said emma; ""but is he sure that harriet mean to marri him?"" ""well, well, mean to make her an offer then. will that do? he came to the abbey two even ago, on purpos to consult me about it. he know i have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, i believe, consid me as one of his best friends. he came to ask me whether i thought it would be imprud in him to settl so early; whether i thought her too young: in short, whether"

""pray, mr. knightley,"" said emma, who had been smile to herself through a great part of this speech, ""how do you know that mr. martin did not speak yesterday?"" ""certainly,"" repli he, surprized, ""i do not absolut know it; but it may be inferred. was not she the whole day with you?"" ""come,"" said she, ""i will tell you something, in return for what you"
austen,romance,"have told me. he did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote, and was refused."" this was oblig to be repeat befor it could be believed; and mr. knightley actual look red with surpriz and displeasure, as he stood up, in tall indignation, and said, ""then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believ her. what is the foolish girl about?"" ""oh! to be sure,"" cri emma, ""it is alway incomprehens to a man that a woman should ever refus an offer of marriage. a man alway imagin a woman to be readi for ani bodi who ask her."" ""nonsense! a man doe not imagin ani such thing. but what is the mean of this? harriet smith refus robert martin? madness, if it is so; but i hope you are mistaken."" ""i saw her answer!--noth could be clearer."" ""you saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too. emma, this is your doing."
austen,romance,"you persuad her to refus him."" ""and if i did, (which, however, i am far from allowing) i should not feel that i had done wrong. mr. martin is a veri respect young man, but i cannot admit him to be harriet equal; and am rather surpriz inde that he should have ventur to address her. by your account, he doe seem to have had some scruples. it is a piti that they were ever got over."" ""not harriet equal!"" exclaim mr. knightley loud and warmly; and with calmer asperity, added, a few moment afterwards, ""no, he is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sens as in situation. emma, your infatu about that girl blind you. what are harriet smith claims, either of birth, natur or education, to ani connexion higher than robert martin? she is the natur daughter of nobodi know whom, with"

""if i had set my heart on mr. elton marri harriet, it would have been veri kind to open my eyes; but at present i onli want to keep harriet to myself. i have done with match-mak indeed. i could never hope to equal my own do at randalls. i shall leav off while i am well."" ""good morn to you,""--said he, rise and walk off abruptly. he was veri much vexed. he felt the disappoint of the young man, and was mortifi to have been the mean of promot it, by the sanction he had given; and"
austen,romance,"the part which he was persuad emma had taken in the affair, was provok him exceedingly. emma remain in a state of vexat too; but there was more indistinct in the caus of her's, than in his. she did not alway feel so absolut satisfi with herself, so entir convinc that her opinion were right and her adversari wrong, as mr. knightley. he walk off in more complet self-approb than he left for her. she was not so materi cast down, however, but that a littl time and the return of harriet were veri adequ restoratives. harriet stay away so long was begin to make her uneasy. the possibl of the young man come to mrs. goddard that morning, and meet with harriet and plead his own cause, gave alarm ideas. the dread of such a failur after all becam the promin uneasiness; and when harriet appeared, and in veri"
austen,romance,"good spirits, and without have ani such reason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfact which settl her with her own mind, and convinc her, that let mr. knightley think or say what he would, she had done noth which woman friendship and woman feel would not justify. he had frighten her a littl about mr. elton; but when she consid that mr. knightley could not have observ him as she had done, neither with the interest, nor (she must be allow to tell herself, in spite of mr. knightley pretensions) with the skill of such an observ on such a question as herself, that he had spoken it hastili and in anger, she was abl to believe, that he had rather said what he wish resent to be true, than what he knew ani thing about. he certain might have heard mr. elton speak with more"
austen,romance,"unreserv than she had ever done, and mr. elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsider disposit as to money matters; he might natur be rather attent than otherwis to them; but then, mr. knightley did not make due allow for the influenc of a strong passion at war with all interest motives. mr. knightley saw no such passion, and of cours thought noth of it effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of it overcom ani hesit that a reason prudenc might origin suggest; and more than a reasonable, becom degre of prudence, she was veri sure did not belong to mr. elton. harriet cheer look and manner establish hers: she came back, not to think of mr. martin, but to talk of mr. elton. miss nash had been tell her something, which she repeat immedi with great delight. mr. perri had been to"
austen,romance,"mrs. goddard to attend a sick child, and miss nash had seen him, and he had told miss nash, that as he was come back yesterday from clayton park, he had met mr. elton, and found to his great surprize, that mr. elton was actual on his road to london, and not mean to return till the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and mr. perri had remonstr with him about it, and told him how shabbi it was in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tri veri much to persuad him to put off his journey onli one day; but it would not do; mr. elton had been determin to go on, and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed, that he was go on busi which he would not put off for ani induc in"
austen,romance,"the world; and someth about a veri enviabl commission, and be the bearer of someth exceed precious. mr. perri could not quit understand him, but he was veri sure there must be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and mr. elton onli look veri conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits. miss nash had told her all this, and had talk a great deal more about mr. elton; and said, look so veri signific at her, ""that she did not pretend to understand what his busi might be, but she onli knew that ani woman whom mr. elton could prefer, she should think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, mr. elton had not his equal for beauti or agreeableness."" chapter ix mr. knightley might quarrel with her, but emma could not quarrel with herself. he was so much displeased, that"
austen,romance,"it was longer than usual befor he came to hartfield again; and when they did meet, his grave look shew that she was not forgiven. she was sorry, but could not repent. on the contrary, her plan and proceed were more and more justifi and endear to her by the general appear of the next few days. the picture, eleg framed, came safe to hand soon after mr. elton return, and be hung over the mantelpiec of the common sitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sigh out his half sentenc of admir just as he ought; and as for harriet feelings, they were visibl form themselv into as strong and steadi an attach as her youth and sort of mind admitted. emma was soon perfect satisfi of mr. martin be no otherwis remembered, than as he furnish a contrast with mr. elton, of the utmost advantag to"
austen,romance,"the latter. her view of improv her littl friend mind, by a great deal of use read and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few first chapters, and the intent of go on to-morrow. it was much easier to chat than to study; much pleasant to let her imagin rang and work at harriet fortune, than to be labour to enlarg her comprehens or exercis it on sober facts; and the onli literari pursuit which engag harriet at present, the onli mental provis she was make for the even of life, was the collect and transcrib all the riddl of everi sort that she could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-press paper, made up by her friend, and ornament with cipher and trophies. in this age of literature, such collect on a veri grand scale are not uncommon. miss nash, head-teach at mrs. goddard's, had"
austen,romance,"written out at least three hundred; and harriet, who had taken the first hint of it from her, hoped, with miss woodhous help, to get a great mani more. emma assist with her invention, memori and taste; and as harriet wrote a veri pretti hand, it was like to be an arrang of the first order, in form as well as quantity. mr. woodhous was almost as much interest in the busi as the girls, and tri veri often to recollect someth worth their put in. ""so mani clever riddl as there use to be when he was young--h wonder he could not rememb them! but he hope he should in time."" and it alway end in ""kitty, a fair but frozen maid."" his good friend perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject, did not at present recollect ani thing of the riddl kind; but he had"
austen,romance,"desir perri to be upon the watch, and as he went about so much, something, he thought, might come from that quarter. it was by no mean his daughter wish that the intellect of highburi in general should be put under requisition. mr. elton was the onli one whose assist she asked. he was invit to contribut ani realli good enigmas, charades, or conundrum that he might recollect; and she had the pleasur of see him most intent at work with his recollections; and at the same time, as she could perceive, most earnest care that noth ungallant, noth that did not breath a compliment to the sex should pass his lips. they owe to him their two or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exult with which at last he recalled, and rather sentiment recited, that well-known charade, my first doth afflict denote, which my second is destin'd"
austen,romance,"to feel and my whole is the best antidot that afflict to soften and heal.-- made her quit sorri to acknowledg that they had transcrib it some page ago already. ""whi will not you write one yourself for us, mr. elton?"" said she; ""that is the onli secur for it freshness; and noth could be easier to you."" ""oh no! he had never written, hard ever, ani thing of the kind in his life. the stupidest fellow! he was afraid not even miss woodhouse""--h stopt a moment--""or miss smith could inspir him."" the veri next day howev produc some proof of inspiration. he call for a few moments, just to leav a piec of paper on the tabl containing, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had address to a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which, from his manner, emma was immedi convinc must"
austen,romance,"be his own. ""i do not offer it for miss smith collection,"" said he. ""be my friend's, i have no right to expos it in ani degre to the public eye, but perhap you may not dislik look at it."" the speech was more to emma than to harriet, which emma could understand. there was deep conscious about him, and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend's. he was gone the next moment:--aft anoth moment pause, ""take it,"" said emma, smiling, and push the paper toward harriet--""it is for you. take your own."" but harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and emma, never loth to be first, was oblig to examin it herself. to miss-- charade. my first display the wealth and pomp of kings, lord of the earth! their luxuri and ease. anoth view of man, my second brings, behold him"

""the gull are eat what the cricket have left! they will strip root and branch!"" but all at once, someon call out,-- ""no, no! see! they are eat the crickets! they are eat onli the crickets!"" it was true. the gull devour the cricket in dozens, in hundreds, in swarms. they ate until they were gorged, and then they flew heavili back to the lake, onli to come again with new appetite. and when at last they finished, they had strip the field of the armi of crickets; and the peopl were saved. to this day, in the beauti citi of salt lake, which grew out of that pioneer village, the littl children are taught to love the sea gulls. and when they learn draw and weav in the schools, their first design is often a pictur of a cricket and"
bryant,stories,"a gull. the nightingal a long, long time ago, as long ago as when there were fairies, there live an emperor in china, who had a most beauti palace, all made of crystal. outsid the palac was the loveliest garden in the whole world, and farther away was a forest where the tree were taller than ani other tree in the world, and farther away, still, was a deep wood. and in this wood live a littl nightingale. the nightingal sang so beauti that everybodi who heard her rememb her song better than anyth els that he heard or saw. peopl came from all over the world to see the crystal palac and the wonder garden and the great forest; but when they went home and wrote book about these thing they alway wrote, ""but the nightingal is the best of all."" at last it happen that the emperor came"
bryant,stories,"upon a book which said this, and he at onc sent for his chamberlain. ""who is this nightingale?"" said the emperor. ""whi have i never heard him sing?"" the chamberlain, who was a veri import person, said, ""there cannot be ani such person; i have never heard his name."" ""the book say there is a nightingale,"" said the emperor. ""i command that the nightingal be brought here to sing for me this evening."" the chamberlain went out and ask all the great lord and ladi and page where the nightingal could be found, but not one of them had ever heard of him. so the chamberlain went back to the emperor and said, ""there is no such person."" ""the book say there is a nightingale,"" said the emperor; ""if the nightingal is not here to sing for me this even i will have the court trampl upon, immedi after supper."""
bryant,stories,"the chamberlain did not want to be trampl upon, so he ran out and ask everybodi in the palac about the nightingale. at last, a littl girl who work in the kitchen to help the cook, said, ""oh, yes, i know the nightingal veri well. everi night, when i go to carri scrap from the kitchen to my mother, who live in the wood beyond the forest, i hear the nightingal sing."" the chamberlain ask the maid to take him to the nightingal home, and mani of the lord and ladi follow after. when they had gone a littl way, they heard a cow moo. ""ah!"" said the lord and ladies, ""that must be the nightingale; what a larg voic for so small a creature!"" ""oh, no,"" said the littl girl, ""that is just a cow, mooing."" a littl farther on they heard some bullfrogs, in a swamp. ""sure that"
bryant,stories,"is the nightingale,"" said the courtiers; ""it realli sound like church-bells!"" ""oh, no,"" said the littl girl, ""those are bullfrogs, croaking."" at last they came to the wood where the nightingal was. ""hush!"" said the littl girl, ""she is go to sing."" and, sure enough, the littl nightingal began to sing. she sang so beauti that you have never in all your life heard anyth like it. ""dear, dear,"" said the courtiers, ""that is veri pleasant; doe that littl grey bird realli make all that noise? she is so pale that i think she has lost her colour for fear of us."" the chamberlain ask the littl nightingal to come and sing for the emperor. the littl nightingal said she could sing better in her own greenwood, but she was so sweet and kind that she came with them. that even the palac was all trim with the most beauti"
bryant,stories,"flower you can imagine, and row and row of littl silver bells, that tinkl when the wind blew in, and hundr and hundr and hundr of wax candles, that shone like tini stars. in the great hall there was a gold perch for the nightingale, besid the emperor throne. when all the peopl were there, the emperor ask the nightingal to sing. then the littl grey nightingal fill her throat full, and sang. and, my dears, she sang so beauti that the emperor eye fill up with tears! and, you know, emperor do not cri at all easily. so he ask her to sing again, and this time she sang so marvel that the tear came out of his eye and ran down his cheeks. that was a great success. they ask the littl nightingal to sing, over and over again, and when they had listen enough the emperor said"
bryant,stories,"that she should be made ""singer in chief to the court."" she was to have a golden perch near the emperor bed, and a littl golden cage, and was to be allow to go out twice everi day. but there were twelv servant appoint to wait on her, and those twelv servant went with her everi time she went out, and each of the twelv had hold of the end of a silken string which was tie to the littl nightingal leg! it was not so veri much fun to go out that way! for a long, long time the nightingal sang everi even to the emperor and his court, and they like her so much that the ladi all tri to sing like her; they use to put water in their mouth and then make littl sound like this: _glu-glu-glug_. and when the courtier met each other in the"
bryant,stories,"halls, one would say ""night,"" and the other would say ""ingale,"" and that was suppos to be conversation. at last, one day, there came a littl packag to the emperor, on the outsid of which was written, ""the nightingale."" insid was an artifici bird, someth like a nightingale, onli it was made of gold, and silver, and rubies, and emeralds, and diamonds. when it was wound up it play a waltz tune, and as it play it move it littl tail up and down. everybodi in the court was fill with delight at the music of the new nightingale. they made it sing that same tune thirty-thre times, and still they had not had enough. they would have made it sing the tune thirty-four times, but the emperor said, ""i should like to hear the real nightingal sing, now."" but when they look about for the real littl nightingale, they"
bryant,stories,"could not find her anywhere! she had taken the chance, while everybodi was listen to the waltz tunes, to fli away through the window to her own greenwood. ""what a veri ungrat bird!"" said the lord and ladies. ""but it doe not matter; the new nightingal is just as good."" so the artifici nightingal was given the real nightingal littl gold perch, and everi night the emperor wound her up, and she sang waltz tune to him. the peopl in the court like her even better than the old nightingale, becaus they could all whistl her tunes,--which you can't do with real nightingales. about a year after the artifici nightingal came, the emperor was listen to her waltz tune, when there was a _snap_ and _whir-r-r_ insid the bird, and the music stopped. the emperor ran to his doctor, but he could not do anything. then he ran to his"
bryant,stories,"clock-maker, but he could not do much. nobodi could do much. the best they could do was to patch the gold nightingal up so that it could sing onc a year; even that was almost too much, and the tune was veri shaky. still, the emperor kept the gold nightingal on the perch in his own room. a long time went by, and then, at last, the emperor grew veri ill, and was about to die. when it was sure that he could not live much longer, the peopl chose a new emperor and wait for the old one to die. the poor emperor lay, quit cold and pale, in his great big bed, with velvet curtain and tall candlestick all about. he was quit alone, for all the courtier had gone to congratul the new emperor, and all the servant had gone to talk it over. when the emperor"
bryant,stories,"woke up, he felt a terribl weight on his chest. he open his eyes, and there was death, sit on his heart. death had put on the emperor gold crown, and he had the gold sceptr in one hand, and the silken banner in the other; and he look at the emperor with his great hollow eyes. the room was full of shadows, and the shadow were full of faces. everywher the emperor looked, there were faces. some were very, veri ugly, and some were sweet and lovely; they were all the thing the emperor had done in his life, good and bad. and as he look at them they began to whisper. they whispered, ""_do you rememb this?_"" ""_do you rememb that?_"" the emperor rememb so much that he cri out loud, ""oh, bring the great drum! make music, so that i may not hear these dread whispers!"" but"
bryant,stories,"there was nobodi there to bring the drum. then the emperor cried, ""you littl gold nightingale, can you not sing someth for me? i have given you gift of gold and jewels, and kept you alway by my side; will you not help me now?"" but there was nobodi to wind the littl gold nightingal up, and of cours it could not sing. the emperor heart grew colder and colder where death crouch upon it, and the dread whisper grew louder and louder, and the emperor life was almost gone. suddenly, through the open window, there came a most love song. it was so sweet and so loud that the whisper die quit away. present the emperor felt his heart grow warm, then he felt the blood flow through his limb again; he listen to the song until the tear ran down his cheeks; he knew that it was the"
bryant,stories,"littl real nightingal who had flown away from him when the gold nightingal came. death was listen to the song, too; and when it was done and the emperor beg for more, death, too, said, ""pleas sing again, littl nightingale!"" ""will you give me the emperor gold crown for a song?"" said the littl nightingale. ""yes,"" said death; and the littl nightingal bought the emperor crown for a song. ""oh, sing again, littl nightingale,"" beg death. ""will you give me the emperor sceptr for anoth song?"" said the littl grey nightingale. ""yes,"" said death; and the littl nightingal bought the emperor sceptr for anoth song. onc more death beg for a song, and this time the littl nightingal obtain the banner for her singing. then she sang one more song, so sweet and so sad that it made death think of his garden in the churchyard, where he alway like"
bryant,stories,"best to be. and he rose from the emperor heart and float away through the window. when death was gone, the emperor said to the littl nightingale, ""oh, dear littl nightingale, you have save me from death! do not leav me again. stay with me on this littl gold perch, and sing to me always!"" ""no, dear emperor,"" said the littl nightingale, ""i sing best when i am free; i cannot live in a palace. but everi night when you are quit alone, i will come and sit in the window and sing to you, and tell you everyth that goe on in your kingdom: i will tell you where the poor peopl are who ought to be helped, and where the wick peopl are who ought to be punished. only, dear emperor, be sure that you never let anybodi know that you have a littl bird who tell you"
bryant,stories,"everything."" after the littl nightingal had flown away, the emperor felt so well and strong that he dress himself in his royal robe and took his gold sceptr in his hand. and when the courtier came in to see if he were dead, there stood the emperor with his sword in one hand and his sceptr in the other, and said, ""good-morning!"" margeri garden there was onc a littl girl name margery, who had alway live in the city. the flat where her mother and father live was at the top of a big building, and you couldn't see a great deal from the windows, except chimney-pot on other peopl roofs. margeri did not know much about tree and flowers, but she love them dearly; whenev it was a fine sunday she use to go with her mother and father to the park and look at the love flower-beds. they"
bryant,stories,"seem alway to be finished, though, and margeri was alway wish she could see them grow. one spring, when margeri was nine, her father obtain a new situat and they remov to a littl hous with a nice big piec of ground a short distanc outsid the town where his new posit was. margeri was delighted. and the veri first thing she said, when her father told her about it, was, ""oh, may i have a garden? _may_ i have a garden?"" margeri mother was almost as eager for a garden as she was, and margeri father said he expect to live on their veget all the rest of his life! so it was soon agre that the garden should be the first thing attend to. behind the cottag were appl trees, a plum tree, and two or three pear trees; then came a stretch of rough grass, and then"
bryant,stories,"a stone wall, with a gate lead into the fields. it was on the grass plot that the garden was to be. a big piec was to be use for wheat and pea and beans, and a littl piec at the end was to be given to margery. ""what shall we have in it?"" ask her mother. ""flowers,"" said margery, with shine eyes,--""blue, and white, and yellow, and pink,--everi kind of flower!"" ""surely, flowers,"" said her mother, ""and shall we not have a littl salad garden in the middle?"" ""what is a salad garden?"" margeri asked. ""it is a garden where you have all the thing that make nice salad,"" said her mother, laughing, for margeri was fond of salads; ""you have lettuce, and endive, and mustard and cress, and parsley, and radishes, and beetroot, and young onions."" ""oh! how good it sounds!"" said margery. ""i should love a salad"
bryant,stories,"garden."" that veri evening, margeri father took pencil and paper, and drew out a plan for her garden; first, they talk it all over, then he drew what they decid on; it look like the diagram on the next page. ""the outsid strip is for flowers,"" said margeri father, ""and next is a footpath, all the way round the beds; that is to let you get at the flower to weed and to pick; there is a wider path through the middle, and the rest is for row of salad vegetables."" ""papa, it is glorious!"" said margery. papa laughed. ""i hope you will still think it glorious when the weed time comes,"" he said, ""for you know, you and mother have promis to take care of this garden, while i take care of the big one."" ""i wouldn't _not_ take care of it for anything!"" said margery. ""i want to"
bryant,stories,"feel that it is my veri own."" [illustration] her father kiss her, and said it was certain her ""veri own."" two even after that, when margeri was call in from her first rambl in the fields, she found the postman at the door. ""someth for you, margery,"" said her mother, with the look she had when someth nice was happening. it was a box, quit a big box, with a label on it that said:-- miss margeri brown, primros cottage, 21 narcissus road, colchester. from seed and plant company, reading. margeri could hard wait to open it. it was fill with littl packages, all with print labels; and in the packages, of course, were seeds. it made margeri dance, just to read the names,--nasturtium, giant helianthus, canariensis, calendula, canterburi bells: more name than i can tell you; and other packages, bigger, that said, ""sweet peas,"" ""french beans,"" ""carrots,"" ""wallflowers,"" and"
bryant,stories,"such things! margeri could almost smell the posies, she was so excited. only, she had seen so littl of flower that she did not know what all the name meant. she did not know that a helianthus was a sunflow until her mother told her so, and she had never seen the dear, blue, bell-shap flower that alway grow in old-fashion gardens, and are call canterburi bells. she thought the calendula must be a strange, grand flower, by it name; but her mother told her it was the gay, sturdy, everydayish littl flower call a marigold. there was a great deal for a littl citi girl to be surpris about, and it did seem as if morn was a long way off! ""did you think you could plant them in the morning?"" ask her mother. ""you know, dear, the ground has to be made readi first; it take a littl"
bryant,stories,"time,--it may be sever day befor you can plant."" that was anoth surprise. margeri had thought she could begin to sow the seed right off. but this was what had happened. earli the next morning, a man came drive up to the cottag with two strong white horses; in his wagon was a plough. i suppos you have seen ploughs, but margeri never had, and she watch with great interest, while the man and her father took the plough from the cart and har the hors to it. it was a great, three-corn piec of sharp steel, with long handl come up from it, so that a man could hold it in place. it look like this:-- [illustration] ""i brought a two-hors plough becaus it virgin soil,"" the man said. margeri wonder what in the world he meant; it had not been cultivated, of course, but what had that do"
bryant,stories,"with the kind of plough? ""what doe he mean, father?"" she whispered, when she got a chance. ""he mean that this land has not been plough before; it will be hard to turn the soil, and one hors could not pull the plough,"" said her father. it took the man two hour to plough the littl strip of land. he drove the sharp end of the plough into the soil, and held it firm so, while the hors drew it along in a straight line. margeri found it fascin to watch the long line of dark earth and green grass come roll up and turn over, as the knife pass it. she could see that it took real skill and strength to keep the line even, and to avoid the stones. sometim the plough struck a hidden stone, and then the man was jerk almost off his feet. but he"
bryant,stories,"onli laughed, and said, ""tough piec of land; it will be a lot better next year."" when he had ploughed, the man went back to his cart and unload anoth farm implement. this one was like a three-corn platform of wood, with a long, curved, strong rake under it. it was call a harrow, and it look like the diagram on the next page. the man har the hors to it, and then he stood on the platform and drove all over the strip of land. it was fun to watch, but perhap it was a littl hard to do. the man weight kept the harrow steady, and let the teeth of the rake scratch and cut the ground up, so that it did not stay in ridges. ""he scrambl the ground, father!"" said margery. ""it need scrambling,'"" laugh her father. ""we are go to get more weed than we"
bryant,stories,"want on this fresh soil, and the more the ground is broken, the fewer there will be."" [illustration] after the plough and harrowing, the man drove off, and margeri father said that he himself would do the rest of the work in the late afternoons, when he came home from business; they could not afford too much help, he said, and he had learn to take care of a garden when he was a boy. so margeri did not see ani more done until the next day. but the next day there was hard work for margeri father! everi bit of that ground had to be broken up still more with a spade, and then the clod which were full of grass-root had to be taken on a fork and shaken, till the earth fell out; when the grass was thrown to one side. that would not have had to"
bryant,stories,"be done if the land had been plough in the autumn; the grass would have rot in the ground, and would have made food for the plants. now, margeri father put the fertilis on the top, and then rake it into the earth. at last, it was time to make the place for the seeds. margeri and her mother helped. father tie one end of a cord to a littl stake, and drove the stake in the ground at one end of the garden. then he took the cord to the other end of the garden and pull it tight, tie it to anoth stake, and drove that down. that made a straight line. then he ho a trench, a few inch deep, the whole length of the cord, and scatter fertilis in it. pretti soon the whole garden was line with littl trenches. ""now for the seed,"" said father."
bryant,stories,"margeri ran and brought the seed box. ""may i help?"" she asked. ""if you watch me sow one row, i think you can do the next,"" said her father. so margeri watched. her father took a hand of peas, and, stooping, walk slowli along the line, let the seed trickl through his fingers. it was pretti to watch; it made margeri think of a photograph her teacher had, a photograph of a famous pictur call ""the sower."" perhap you have seen it. put in the seed was not so easi to do as to watch; sometim margeri drop in too much, and sometim not enough; but her father was patient with her, and soon she did better. they plant peas, beans, spinach, carrots, and parsnips. and margeri father made a row of holes, after that, for the tomato plants. he said those had to be transplanted; they could not be"
bryant,stories,"sown from seed. when the seed were in the trench they had to be cover up, and margeri realli help at that. it is fun to do it. you stand besid the littl trench and walk backward, and as you walk you hoe the loos earth back over the seeds; the same earth that was ho up you pull back again. then you rake veri gentl over the surface, with the back of a rake, to even it all off. margeri like it, becaus now the garden began to look _like_ a garden. but best of all was the work next day, when her own littl particular garden was begun. father brown love margeri and margeri mother so much that he want their garden to be perfect, and that meant a great deal more work. he knew veri well that the old grass would begin to come through again on"
bryant,stories,"such soil, and that it would make terribl hard weeding. he was not go to have ani such thing for his two ""littl girls,"" as he call them. so he gave that littl garden particular attention. this is what he did. after he had thrown out all the turf, he shovel clean earth on to the garden,--a much as three solid inch of it; not a bit of grass was in that. then it was readi for rake and fertilising, and for the lines. the littl footpath were mark out by father brown feet; margeri and her mother laugh well at his actions, for it look like some kind of dance. mr brown had seen garden do it when he was a littl boy, and he did it veri nicely: he walk along the side of the square, with one foot turn a littl out, and the other straight, take"
bryant,stories,"such tini step that his feet touch each other all the time. this tramp out a path just wide enough for a person to walk. the wider path was mark with line and raked. margeri thought, of course, all the flower would be put in as the veget were; but she found that it was not so. for some, her father poke littl hole with his finger; for some, he made veri shallow trenches; and some veri small seed were scatter light over the top of the ground. margeri and her mother had taken so much pain in think out the arrang of the flowers, that perhap you will like to hear just how they design that garden. at the back were the sweet peas, which would grow tall, like a screen; on the two sides, for a kind of hedge, were yellow sunflowers; and along the front edg were"
bryant,stories,"the gay nasturtiums. margeri plan that, so that she could look into the garden from the front, but have it shut away from the veget patch by the tall flower on the sides. the two front corner had canariensi in them. canariensi is a pretti creeper with golden blossoms, veri dainti and bright. and then, in littl squar patch all round the garden, were plant london pride, blue bachelor buttons, yellow marigolds, tall larkspur, many-colour asters, hollyhock and stocks. all these love flower use to grow in our grandmoth gardens, and if you don't know what they look like, i hope you can find out next summer. between the flower and the middl path went the seed for that wonder salad garden; all the thing mrs brown had name to margeri were there. margeri had never seen anyth more wonder than the littl round lettuce-seeds. they were so tini that"
bryant,stories,"it did not seem possibl that green lettuc leav could come from them. but they sure would. mother and father and margeri were late to supper that evening. but they were all so happi that it did not matter. the last thing margeri thought of, as she went to sleep at night, was the dear, smooth littl garden, with it funni footpath, and with the littl stick stand at the end of the rows, label ""lettuce,"" ""beets,"" ""helianthus,"" and so on. ""i have a garden! i have a garden!"" was margeri last thought as she went off to dreamland. the littl cotyledon this is anoth stori about margeri garden. the next morn after the garden was planted, margeri was up and out at six o'clock. she could not wait to look at her garden. to be sure, she knew that the seed could not sprout in a singl night, but"
bryant,stories,"she had a feel that _something_ might happen at ani moment. the garden was just as smooth and brown as the night before, and no littl seedl were in sight. but a veri few morn after that, when margeri went out, she saw a funni littl crack open up through the earth, the whole length of the patch. quick she knelt down on the footpath, to see. yes! tini green leaves, a whole row of them, were push their way through the crust! margeri knew what she had put there: it was the radish-row; these must be radish leaves. she examin them veri closely, so that she might know a radish next time. the littl leaves, no bigger than half your little-fing nail, grew in twos,--two on each tini stem; they were almost round. margeri flew back to her mother, to say that the first seed were up. and her"
bryant,stories,"mother, near as excit as margery, came to look at the littl crack. each day, after that, the row of radish grew, till, in a week, it stood as high as your finger, green and sturdy. but about the third day, while margeri was stoop over the radishes, she saw someth very, veri small and green, peep abov ground, where the lettuc was planted. could it be weeds? no, for on look veri close she saw that the wee leav faint mark a regular row. they did not make a crack, like the radishes; they seem too small and too far apart to push the earth up like that. margeri lean down and look with all her eye at the babi plants. the tini leav grew two on a stem, and were almost round. the more she look at them the more it seem to margeri that they look exact"
bryant,stories,"as the radish look when it first came up. ""do you suppose,"" margeri said to herself, ""that lettuc and radish look alik while they are growing? they don't look alik when they are on the table!"" day by day the lettuc grew, and soon the littl round leav were easier to examine; they certain were veri much like radish leaves. then, one morning, while she was search for sign of other seeds, margeri discov the beets. in irregular patch on the row, hint of green were coming. the next day and the next they grew, until the beet leav were big enough to see. margeri looked. then she look again. then she wrinkl her forehead. ""can we have made a mistake?"" she thought. ""do you suppos we can have plant _all_ radishes?"" for those littl beet leav were almost round, and they grew two on a stem, precis like the"
bryant,stories,"lettuc and the radish; except for the size, all three row look alike. it was too much for margery. she ran to the hous and found her father. her littl face was so anxious that he thought someth unpleas had happened. ""papa,"" she said, all out of breath, ""do you think we could have made a mistak about my garden? do you think we could have put radish in all the rows?"" father laughed. ""what make you think such a thing?"" he asked. ""papa,"" said margery, ""the littl leav all look exact alike! everi plant has just two tini leav on it, and shape the same; they are roundish, and grow out of the stem at the same place."" papa eye began to twinkle. ""mani of the dicotyledon plant look alik at the beginning,"" he said, with a littl drawl on the big word. that was to teas margery, becaus"
bryant,stories,"she alway want to know the big word she heard. ""what dicotyledonous'?"" said margery, carefully. ""wait till i come home to-night, dear,"" said her father, ""and i'll tell you."" that even margeri was wait eager for him. when her father finish his supper they went togeth to the garden, and father examin the seedl carefully. then he pull up a littl radish plant and a tini beet. ""these littl leaves,"" he said, ""are not the real leav of the plant; they are onli littl pocket to hold food for the plant to live on till it get strong enough to push up into the air. as soon as the real leav come out and begin to draw food from the air, these littl substitut wither up and fall off. these two lie fold up in the littl seed from the beginning, and are full of plant food. they don't have"
bryant,stories,"to be veri special in shape, you see, becaus they don't stay on the plant after it is grown up."" ""then everi plant look like this at first?"" said margery. ""no, dear, not everi one; plant are divid into two kinds: those which have two food leaves, like these plants, and those which have onli one; these are call dicotyledonous, and the one which have but one food leaf are monocotyledonous. mani of the dicotyledon look alike."" ""i think that is interesting,"" said margery. ""i always, suppos the plant were differ from the minut they began to grow."" ""indeed, no,"" said father. ""even some of the tree look like this when they first come through; you would not think a birch tree could look like a veget or a flower, would you? but it does, at first; it look so much like these thing that in the great nurseries, where"
bryant,stories,"tree are rais for forest and parks, the workmen have to be veri care trained, or els they would pull up the tree when they are weeding. they have to be taught the differ between a birch tree and a weed."" ""how funny!"" said margery, dimpling. ""yes, it sound funny,"" said father; ""but, you see, the birch tree is dicotyledonous, and so are mani weeds, and the dicotyledon look so much alik at first."" ""i am glad to know that, father,"" said margery, soberly. ""i believ i shall learn a good deal from live in the country; don't you think so?"" margeri father took her in his arms. ""i hope so, dear,"" he said; ""the countri is a good place for littl girls."" and that was all that happened, that day. the talkat tortois onc upon a time, a tortois live in a pond with two ducks, who were her"
bryant,stories,"veri good friends. she enjoy the compani of the ducks, becaus she could talk with them to her heart content; the tortois like to talk. she alway had someth to say, and she like to hear herself say it. after mani year of this pleasant living, the pond becam veri low, in a dri season; and final it dri up. the two duck saw that they could no longer live there, so they decid to fli to anoth region, where there was more water. they went to the tortois to bid her good-bye. ""oh, don't leav me behind!"" beg the tortoise. ""take me with you; i must die if i am left here."" ""but you cannot fly!"" said the ducks. ""how can we take you with us?""

""open the doors, cabby,"" he repeated, with someth of the obstin solemn of a drunkard, ""open the doors. did ye no hear me say st. pancra station?"" the top of a policeman helmet appear abov the garden wall. the cabman did not see it, but he was still suspici and began: ""veri sorry, sir, but..."" and with that the catlik turnbul tore him out of his seat and hurl him into the street below, where he lay sudden stunned.

chesterton,fiction,"interest simpli is that thing should happen. it is the one great weak of journal as a pictur of our modern existence, that it must be a pictur made up entir of exceptions. we announc on flare poster that a man has fallen off a scaffolding. we do not announc on flare poster that a man has not fallen off a scaffolding. yet this latter fact is fundament more exciting, as indic that that move tower of terror and mystery, a man, is still abroad upon the earth. that the man has not fallen off a scaffold is realli more sensational; and it is also some thousand time more common. but journal cannot reason be expect thus to insist upon the perman miracles. busi editor cannot be expect to put on their posters, ""mr. wilkinson still safe,"" or ""mr. jones, of worthing, not dead yet."" they cannot announc the happi"

""yes,"" he said, with a sort of stupidity. ""it a veri big place."" there was a somewhat unmean silence, and then macian said again: ""it a veri big place. when i first came into it i was frighten of it. frighten"

""like the land of the brobdingnagians,"" said turnbull, smiling. ""oh! where is that?"" said macian. turnbul said bitterly, ""in a book,"" and the silenc fell sudden between them again. they were sit in a"
chesterton,fiction,"sort of litter on the hillside; all the thing they had hurri collected, in various places, for their flight, were strewn indiscrimin round them. the two sword with which they had late sought each other live were flung down on the grass at random, like two idl walking-sticks. some provis they had bought last night, at a low public house, in case of undefin contingencies, were toss about like the materi of an ordinari picnic, here a basket of chocolate, and there a bottl of wine. and to add to the disord finally, there were strewn on top of everything, the most disord of modern things, newspapers, and more newspapers, and yet again newspapers, the minist of the modern anarchy. turnbul pick up one of them drearily, and took out a pipe.

chesterton,fiction,"heart of the other was awakened. it was not in that way that the sword rang togeth when they had rush on each other in the littl garden behind the dealer shop. there was a pause, and then macian made a movement as if to thrust, and almost at the same moment turnbul sudden and calm drop his sword. evan stare round in an unusu bewilderment, and then realiz that a larg man in pale cloth and a panama hat was stroll seren toward them. v. the peacemak when the combatants, with cross swords, becam sudden conscious of a third party, they each made the same movement. it was as quick as the snap of a pistol, and they alter it instantan and recov their origin pose, but they had both made it, they had both seen it, and they both knew what it was. it was not a movement"

chesterton,fiction,"night. it was someth that seem all the more merciless, becaus it might turn out an enorm mercy. was there, perhaps, some such fatal in friendship as all lover talk about in love? did god make men love each other against their will? ""i'm sure you'll excus my speak to you,"" said the stranger, in a voic at onc eager and deprecating. the voic was too polit for good manners. it was incongru with the eccentr spectacl of the duellist which ought to have startl a sane and free man. it was also incongru with the full and healthy, though rather loos physiqu of the man who spoke. at the first glanc he look a fine animal, with curl gold beard and hair, and blue eyes, unusu bright. it was onli at the second glanc that the mind felt a sudden and perhap unmean irrit at the way in which"
chesterton,fiction,"the gold beard retreat backward into the waistcoat, and the way in which the fine shape nose went forward as if smell it way. and it was only, perhaps, at the hundredth glanc that the bright blue eyes, which normal befor and after the instant seem brilliant with intelligence, seem as it were to be brilliant with idiocy. he was a heavy, healthy-look man, who look all the larger becaus of the loose, light colour cloth that he wore, and that had in their extrem light and looseness, almost a touch of the tropics. but a closer examin of his attir would have shown that even in the tropic it would have been unique; but it was all woven accord to some hygien textur which no human be had ever heard of before, and which was absolut necessari even for a day health. he wore a huge broad-brim hat, equal"

""i'm sure you'll excus my speak to you,"" he said. ""now, i wonder if you are in some littl difficulti which, after all, we could settl veri comfort together? now, you don't mind my say this, do you?"" the face of both combat remain somewhat solid under this appeal. but the stranger, probabl take their silenc for a gather shame, continu with a kind of gaiety: ""so you are the young men i have read about in the papers. well, of course, when one is young, one is rather romantic. do you know what i alway say to young people?"" a blank silenc follow this gay inquiry. then turnbul said in a colourless voice: ""as i was forty-seven"

""but you know this is a serious matter,"" he said, eye turnbul and macian, as if they had just been keep the tabl in a roar with their frivolities. ""i am sure that if i appeal to your higher natures...your higher natures. everi man has a higher natur and a lower nature. now, let us put the matter veri plainly, and without ani romant nonsens about honour or anyth of that sort. is not bloodsh a great sin?"" ""no,"" said macian, speak for the first time. ""well, really, really!"" said the peacemaker. ""murder is"
chesterton,fiction,"a sin,"" said the immov highlander. ""there is no sin of bloodshed."" ""well, we won't quarrel about a word,"" said the other, pleasantly.

chesterton,fiction,"there is as much differ between those word as there is between the word yes and the word no'; or rather more difference, for yes and no', at least, belong to the same category. murder is a spiritu incident. bloodsh is a physic incident. a surgeon commit bloodshed.

""now, do you know what i alway say to casuists...?"" macian made a violent gesture; and turnbul broke into open laughter. the peacemak did not seem to be in the least annoyed, but continu in unab enjoyment. ""well, well,"" he said, ""let us get back to the point. now tolstoy has shown that forc is no remedy; so you see the posit in which i am placed. i am do my best to stop what i'm sure you won't mind my call this realli useless violence, this realli quit wrong violenc"

""an hour ago,"" said the highlander, in his heavi medit voice, ""i felt the devil weaken my heart and my oath against you, and i pray that god would send an angel to my aid."" ""well?"" inquir the other, finish his mend and wrap the rest of the string round his hand to get a firmer grip. ""well?"" ""well, that man was an angel,"" said macian. ""i didn't know they were as bad as that,"" answer turnbull. ""we know that devil sometim quot scriptur and counterfeit good,"" repli the mystic.

""what nois is that?"" ask the highlander, hoarsely. ""i think i know,"" repli turnbull. ""what?... what?"" cri the other. ""the student of shaw and tolstoy has made up his remark mind,"" said turnbull, quietly. ""the polic are come up the hill."" vi. the other philosoph between high hedg in hertfordshire, hedg so high as to creat a kind of grove, two men were running. they did not run in a scamper or feverish manner, but in the steadi swing of the pendulum. across the great plain and upland to the right and left of the lane, a long tide of sunset light roll"
chesterton,fiction,"like a sea of ruby, light up the long terrac of the hill and pick out the few window of the scatter hamlet in startl blood-r sparks. but the lane was cut deep in the hill and remain in an abrupt shadow. the two men run in it had an impress not uncommon experienc between those wild green english walls; a sens of be led between the wall of a maze. though their pace was steadi it was vigorous; their face were heat and their eye fix and bright. there was, indeed, someth a littl mad in the contrast between the even still over the empti country-side, and these two figur flee wild from nothing. they had the look of two lunatics, possibl they were. ""are you all right?"" said turnbull, with civility. ""can you keep this up?"" ""quit easily, thank you,"" repli macian. ""i run veri well."" ""is that"
chesterton,fiction,"a qualif in a famili of warriors?"" ask turnbull. ""undoubtedly. rapid movement is essential,"" answer macian, who never saw a joke in his life. turnbul broke out into a short laugh, and silenc fell between them, the pant silenc of runners. then macian said: ""we run better than ani of those policemen. they are too fat. whi do you make your policemen so fat?"" ""i didn't do much toward make them fat myself,"" repli turnbull, genially, ""but i flatter myself that i am now do someth toward make them thin. you'll see they will be as lean as rake by the time they catch us. they will look like your friend, cardin manning."" ""but they won't catch us,"" said macian, in his liter way. ""no, we beat them in the great militari art of run away,"" return the other. ""they won't catch us unless----"" macian turn his long equin face"
chesterton,fiction,"inquiringly. ""unless what?"" he said, for turnbul had gone silent suddenly, and seem to be listen intent as he ran as a hors doe with his ear turn back. ""unless what?"" repeat the highlander. ""unless they do--what they have done. listen."" macian slacken his trot, and turn his head to the trail they had left behind them. across two or three billow of the up and down lane came along the ground the unmistak throb of hors hoofs. ""they have put the mount polic on us,"" said turnbull, shortly. ""good lord, one would think we were a revolution."" ""so we are,"" said macian calmly. ""what shall we do? shall we turn on them with our points?"" ""it may come to that,"" answer turnbull, ""though if it does, i reckon that will be the last act. we must put it off if we can."" and he stare and peer about him"
chesterton,fiction,"between the bushes. ""if we could hide somewher the beast might go by us,"" he said. ""the polic have their faults, but thank god they'r inefficient. why, here the veri thing. be quick and quiet. follow me."" he sudden swung himself up the high bank on one side of the lane. it was almost as high and smooth as a wall, and on the top of it the black hedg stood out over them as an angle, almost like a thatch roof of the lane. and the burn even sky look down at them through the tangl with red eye as of an armi of goblins. turnbul hoist himself up and broke the hedg with his body. as his head and shoulder rose abov it they turn to flame in the full glow as if lit up by an immens firelight. his red hair and beard look almost scarlet, and"
chesterton,fiction,"his pale face as bright as a boy's. someth violent, someth that was at onc love and hatred, surg in the strang heart of the gael below him. he had an unutter sens of epic importance, as if he were somehow lift all human into a prouder and more passion region of the air. as he swung himself up also into the even light he felt as if he were rise on enorm wings. legend of the morn of the world which he had heard in childhood or read in youth came back upon him in a cloudi splendour, purpl tale of wrath and friendship, like roland and oliver, or balin and balan, remind him of emot entanglements. men who had love each other and then fought each other; men who had fought each other and then love each other, togeth made a mix but monstrous sens of momentousness. the"
chesterton,fiction,"crimson sea of the sunset seem to him like a burst out of some sacr blood, as if the heart of the world had broken. turnbul was wholli unaffect by ani written or spoken poetry; his was a power and prosaic mind. but even upon him there came for the moment someth out of the earth and the passion end of the sky. the onli evid was in his voice, which was still practic but a shade more quiet. ""do you see that summer-house-look thing over there?"" he ask shortly. ""that will do for us veri well."" keep himself free from the tangl of the hedg he stroll across a triangl of obscur kitchen garden, and approach a dismal shed or lodg a yard or two beyond it. it was a weather-stain hut of grey wood, which with all it desol retain a tag or two of trivial ornament, which"
chesterton,fiction,"suggest that the thing had onc been a sort of summer-house, and the place probabl a sort of garden. ""that is quit invis from the road,"" said turnbull, as he enter it, ""and it will cover us up for the night."" macian look at him grave for a few moments. ""sir,"" he said, ""i ought to say someth to you. i ought to say----"" ""hush,"" said turnbull, sudden lift his hand; ""be still, man."" in the sudden silence, the drum of the distant hors grew louder and louder with inconceiv rapidity, and the cavalcad of polic rush by below them in the lane, almost with the roar and rattl of an express train. ""i ought to tell you,"" continu macian, still stare stolid at the other, ""that you are a great chief, and it is good to go to war behind you."" turnbul said nothing, but turn and look out"
chesterton,fiction,"of the foolish lattic of the littl windows, then he said, ""we must have food and sleep first."" when the last echo of their elud pursuer had die in the distant uplands, turnbul began to unpack the provis with the easi air of a man at a picnic. he had just laid out the last items, put a bottl of wine on the floor, and a tin of salmon on the window-ledge, when the bottomless silenc of that forgotten place was broken. and it was broken by three heavi blow of a stick deliv upon the door. turnbul look up in the act of open a tin and stare silent at his companion. macian long, lean mouth had shut hard. ""who the devil can that be?"" said turnbull. ""god knows,"" said the other. ""it might be god."" again the sound of the wooden stick reverber on the wooden door. it"

edgeworth,children,"neatly, and isabella and carolin employ her to work for them; by which she earn a great deal more than she could by spinning. at her leisur hour she taught her sister to read and write; and edmund, with part of the money which he earn by his work out of doors, paid a schoolmast for teach him a littl arithmetic. when the winter night came on, he use to light his rush candl for mari to work by. he had gather and strip a good provis of rush in the month of august, and a neighbour gave him greas to dip them in. one evening, just as he had light his candles, a footman came in, who was sent by isabella with some plain work to mary. this servant was an englishman, and he was but newli come over to ireland. the rush candl caught his attention; for he"
edgeworth,children,"had never seen ani of them before, as he came from a part of england where they were not used. edmund, who was readi to oblige, and proud that his candl were notic show the englishman how they were made, and gave him a bundl of rushes.* [*""the proper speci of rush,"" say white, in his natur histori of selborne, ""seem to be the juncus effusus, or common soft rush, which is to be found in moist pastures, by the side of streams, and under hedges. these rush are in best condit in the height of summer, but may be gather so as to serv the purpos well quit on to autumn. the largest and longest are the best. decay labourers, women, and children make it their busi to procur and prepar them. as soon as they are cut, they must be flung into water, and kept there; for otherwis"

edgeworth,children,"servant name) alway employ his littl friend edmund, whom, upon further acquaintance, he like better and better. he found that edmund was both quick and exact in execut commissions. one day, after he had wait a great while at a gentleman hous for an answer to a letter, he was so impati to get home that he ran off without it. when he was question by gilbert whi he did not bring an answer, he did not attempt to make ani excuse; he did not say, ""there was no answer, pleas your honour,"" or, ""they bid me not to wait,"" etc.; but he told exact the truth; and though gilbert scold him for be so impati as not to wait, yet his tell the truth was more to the boy advantag than ani excus he could have made. after this he was alway believ when he said, ""there was no"
edgeworth,children,"answer,"" or, ""they bid me not wait""; for gilbert knew that he would not tell a lie to save himself from be scolded. the orphan continu to assist one anoth in their work accord to their strength and abilities; and they went on in this manner for three years. with what mari got by her spin and plain work, and edmund by lead of cart-horses, go on errands, etc., and with littl peggi and ann earnings, the famili contriv to live comfortably. isabella and carolin often visit them, and sometim gave them clothes, and sometim flax or cotton for their spin and knitting; and these children did not expect, that becaus the ladi did someth for them, they should do everything. they did not grow idl or wasteful. when edmund was about twelv year old, his friend gilbert sent for him one day, and told him that his master had"
edgeworth,children,"given him leav to have a boy in the hous to assist him, and that his master told him he might choos one in the neighbourhood. sever were anxious to get into such a good place: but gilbert said that he prefer edmund befor them all, becaus he knew him to be an industrious, honest, good natur lad, who alway told the truth. so edmund went into servic at the vicarage; and his master was the father of isabella and caroline. he found his new way of life veri pleasant; for he was well fed, well clothed, and well treated; and he everi day learn more of his business, in which at first he was rather awkward. he was mind to do all that mr. gilbert requir of him; and he was so oblig to all his fellow-serv that they could not help like him. but there was one thing"
edgeworth,children,"which was at first rather disagre to him: he was oblig to wear shoe and stockings, and they hurt his feet. besid this, when he wait at dinner he made such a nois in walk that his fellow-serv laugh at him. he told his sister mari of his distress, and she made for him, after mani trials, a pair of cloth shoes, with sole of plat hemp.* in these he could walk without make the least noise; and as these shoe could not be worn out of doors, he was alway sure to chang them befor he went out; and consequ he had alway clean shoe to wear in the house. [*the author has seen a pair of shoes, such as here described, made in a few hours.] it was soon remark by the men-serv that he had left off clump so heavily, and it was observ by the maid"

edgeworth,children,"went on with her littl manufactur with increas activity. peggi and ann plat the packthread, and bast the vamp and line togeth readi for her. edmund was allow to come home for an hour everi morning, provid he was back again befor eight o'clock. it was summer time, and he got up early, becaus he like to go home to see his sisters, and he took his share in the manufactory. it was his busi to hammer the sole flat: and as soon as he came home everi morn he perform his task with so much cheer and sang so merrili at his work, that the hour of his arriv was alway an hour of joy to the family. mari had present employ enough upon her hands. order came to her for shoe from mani famili in the neighbourhood, and she could not get them finish fast enough. she, however,"
edgeworth,children,"in the midst of her hurry, found time to make a veri pretti pair, with neat roses, as a present for her schoolmistress, who, now that she saw her pupil in a good way of business, consent to receiv the amount of her old debt. sever of the children who went to her school were delight with the sight of mari present, and went to the littl manufactori at rossmor castle, to find out how these shoe were made. some went from curiosity, other from idleness; but when they saw how happi the littl shoemak seem whilst busi at work, they long to take some share in what was go forward. one beg mari to let her plat some packthread for the soles; anoth help peggi and ann to bast in the linings; and all who could get employ were pleased, for the idl one were shove out of the"
edgeworth,children,"way. it becam a custom with the children of the villag to resort to the old castl at their play hours; and it was surpris to see how much was done by ten or twelv of them, each do but a littl at a time. one morn edmund and the littl manufactur were assembl veri early, and they were busi at their work, all sit round the meal chest, which serv them for a table. ""mi hand must be washed,"" said george, a littl boy who came run in; ""i ran so fast that i might be in time, to go to work along with you all, that i tumbl down, and look how i have dirti my hands. most hast worst speed. my hand must be wash befor i can do anything."" whilst georg was wash his hands, two other littl children, who had just finish their morn work,"
edgeworth,children,"came to him to beg that he would blow some soap bubbl for them, and they were all three eager blow bubbles, and watch them mount into the air, when sudden they were startl by a nois as loud as thunder. they were in a sort of outer court of the castle, next to the room in which all their companion were at work, and they ran precipit into the room, exclaiming, ""did you hear that noise?"" ""i thought i heard a clap of thunder,"" said mary, ""but whi do you look so frightened?"" as she finish speaking, anoth and a louder noise, and the wall round about them shook. the children turn pale and stood motionless; but edmund threw down his hammer, and ran out to see what was the matter. mari follow him, and they saw that a great chimney of the old ruin at the farthest side"
edgeworth,children,"of the castl had fallen down, and this was the caus of the prodigi noise. the part of the castl in which they live seemed, as edmund said, to be perfect safe; but the children of the villag were terrified, and think that the whole would come tumbl down directly, they ran to their home as fast as they could. edmund, who was a courag lad, and proud of show his courage, laugh at their cowardice; but mary, who was veri prudent, persuad her brother to ask an experienc mason, who was build at his master's, to come and give his opinion, whether their part of the castl was safe to live in or not. the mason came, and gave it as his opinion that the room they inhabit might last through the winter but that no part of the ruin could stand anoth year. mari was sorri to leav"
edgeworth,children,"a place of which she had grown fond, poor as it was, have live in it in peac and content ever sinc her mother death, which was now near four years; but she determin to look out for some other place to live in; and she had now money enough to pay the rent of a comfort cabin. without lose ani time, she went to the villag that was at the end of the avenu lead to the vicarage, for she wish to get a lodg in this villag becaus it was so near to her brother, and to the ladi who had been so kind to her. she found that there was one newli built hous in this villag unoccupied; it belong to mr. harvey, her landlord, who was still in england; it was slated, and neat fit up inside; but the rent of it was six guinea a"
edgeworth,children,"year, and this was far abov what mari could afford to pay. three guinea a year she thought was the highest rent for which she could ventur to engage. besides, she heard that sever propos had been made to mr. harvey for this house, and she knew that mr. hopkins, the agent, was not her friend; therefor she despair of get it. there was no other to be had in this village. her brother was still more vex than she was, that she could not find a place near him. he offer to give a guinea year toward the rent out of his wages; and mr. gilbert spoke about it for him to the steward, and inquir whether, amongst ani of those who had given in proposals, there might not be one who would be content with a part of the house, and who would join with mari in pay"
edgeworth,children,"the rent. none could be found but a woman, who was a great scold, and a man who was famous for go to law about everi trifl with his neighbours. mari did not choos to have anyth to do with these people. she did not like to speak either to miss isabella or carolin about it, becaus she was not of an encroach temper; and when they had done so much for her, she would have been asham to beg for more. she return home to the old castle, mortifi that she had no good news to tell ann and peggy, who she knew expect to hear that she had found a nice hous for them in the villag near their brother. ""bad news for you, peggy,"" cri she, as soon as she got home. ""and bad news for you, mary,"" repli her sisters, who look veri sorrowful. ""what the"
edgeworth,children,"matter?"" ""your poor goat is dead,"" repli peggy. ""there she is, yonder, lie under the great corner stone; you can just see her leg. we cannot lift the stone from off her, it is so heavy. betsi [one of the neighbour girls] say she remembers, when she came to us to work earli this morning, she saw the goat rub itself, and but with it horn against that old totter chimney."" ""mani the time,"" said mary, ""that i have driven the poor thing away from that place; i was alway afraid she would shake that great ugli stone down upon her at last."" the goat, who had long been the favourit of mari and her sisters, was lament by them all. when edmund came, he help them to move the great stone from off the poor animal, who was crush so as to be a terribl sight. as they were"
edgeworth,children,"move away this stone in order to buri the goat, ann found an odd-look piec of money, which seem neither like a halfpenny, nor a shilling, nor a guinea. ""here are more, a great mani more of them,"" cri peggy; and upon search amongst the rubbish, they discov a small iron pot, which seem as if it had been fill with these coins, as a vast number of them were found about the spot where it fell. on examin these coins, edmund thought that sever of them look like gold, and the girl exclaim with great joy--""oh, mary! mary! this is come to us just in right time--now you can pay for the slate house. never was anyth so lucky!"" but mary, though noth could have pleas her better than to have been abl to pay for the house, observ that they could not honest touch ani of this treasure,"
edgeworth,children,"as it belong to the owner of the castle. edmund agre with her, that they ought to carri it all immedi to mr. hopkins, the agent. peggi and ann were convinc by what mari said, and they beg to go along with her and their brother, to take the coin to mr. hopkins. on their way they stop at the vicarage, to show the treasur to mr. gilbert, who took it to the young ladies, isabella and caroline, and told them how it had been found. it is not onli by their superior riches, but it is yet more by their superior knowledge, that person in the higher rank of life may assist those in a lower condition. isabella, who had some knowledg of chemistry, discovered, by touch the coin with nitric acid, that sever of them were of gold, and consequ of great value. carolin also found out that"
edgeworth,children,"mani of the coin were veri valuabl as curiosities. she recollect her father have shown to her the print of the coin at the end of each king reign, in ""rapin histori of england;"" and upon compar these impress with the coin found by the orphans, she perceiv that mani of them were of the reign of henri the seventh, which, from their scarcity, were high appreci by numismat collectors. isabella and caroline, know someth of the charact of mr. hopkins, the agent, had the precaut to count the coins, and to mark each of them with a cross, so small that it was scarc visibl to the nake eye, though it was easili to be seen through a magnifi glass. they also beg that their father, who was well acquaint with mr. harvey, the gentleman to whom rossmor castl belonged, to write to him, and tell him how well"
edgeworth,children,"these orphan had behav about the treasur which they had found. the valu of the coin was estim at about thirti or forti guineas. a few day after the fall of the chimney at rossmor castle, as mari and her sister were sit at their work, there came hobbl in an old woman, lean on a crab stick, that seem to have been newli cut. she had a broken tobacco-pip in her mouth; her head was wrap up in two larg red and blue handkerchiefs, with their crook corner hang far down over the back of her neck, no shoe on her broad feet, nor stock on her many-colour legs. her petticoat was jag at the bottom, and the skirt of her gown turn up over her shoulders, to serv instead of a cloak, which she had sold for whisky. this old woman was well known amongst the countri peopl"
edgeworth,children,"by the name of goodi grope:* becaus she had, for mani years, been in the habit of grope in old castles, and in moats,** and at the bottom of a round tower*** in the neighbourhood, in search of treasure. in her youth she had heard someon talking, in a whisper, of an old prophecy, found in a bog, which said that befor mani ""st. patrick day should come about, there would be found a treasur under ground, by one within twenti mile round."" this propheci made a deep impress upon her. she also dream of it three times: and as the dream, she thought, was a sure token that the propheci was to come true, she, from that time forwards, gave up her spinning-wheel and her knitting, and could think of noth but hunt for the treasure, that was to be found by one ""within twenti mile round."" [*goodi is"
edgeworth,children,"not a word use in ireland. collyogh is the irish appel of an old woman: but as collyogh might sound strang to english ears, we have translat it by the word goody. **what are in ireland call moats, are, in england, call danish mounds, or barrows. ***near kells, in ireland, there is a round tower, which was in immin danger of be pull down by an old woman root at it foundation, in hope of find treasure.] year after year st. patrick day came about, without her ever find a farth by all her groping; and as she was alway idle, she grew poorer and poorer. besides, to comfort herself for her disappointments, and to give her spirit for fresh searches, she took to drinking. she sold all she had by degrees; but still she fanci that the lucki day would come sooner or later, that would pay for all."
edgeworth,children,"goodi grope, however, reach her sixtieth year, without ever see this lucki day; and now, in her old age, she was a beggar, without a hous to shelter her, a bed to lie on, or food to put into her mouth, but what she beg from the chariti of those who had trust more than she had to industri and less to luck. ""ah, mary, honey! give me a potato and a sup of something, for the love o' mercy; for not a bit have i had all day, except half a glass of whiski and a halfpenni worth of tobacco!"" mari immedi set befor her some milk, and pick a good potato out of the bowl for her. she was sorri to see such an old woman in such a wretch condition. goodi grope said she would rather have spirit of some kind or other than milk; but mari"
edgeworth,children,"had no spirit to give her; so she sat herself down close to the fire, and after she had sigh and groan and smoke for some time, she said to mary, ""well, and what have you done with the treasur you had the luck to find?"" mari told her that she had carri it to mr. hopkins, the agent. ""that not what i would have done in your place,"" repli the old woman. ""when good luck came to you, what a shame to turn your back upon it! but it is idl talk of what done--that past; but i'll tri my luck in this here castl befor next st. patrick day come about. i was told it was more than twenti mile from our bog or i would have been here long ago; but better late than never."" mari was much alarmed, and not without reason, at this speech; for"
edgeworth,children,"she knew that if goodi grope onc set to work at the foundat of the old castl of rossmore, she would soon bring it all down. it was in vain to talk to goodi grope of the danger of buri herself under the ruins, or of the improb of her meet with anoth pot of gold coins. she set her elbow upon her knees, and stop her ear with her hand bid mari and her sister not to wast their breath advis their elders; for that, let them say what they would, she would fall to work the next morning, ""bar you'll make it worth my while to let it alone."" ""and what will make it worth your while to let it alone?"" said mary; for she saw that she must either get into a quarrel or give up her habitation, or compli with the condit of this provok old"
edgeworth,children,"woman. half a crown, goodi grope said, was the least she could be content to take. mari paid the half-crown, and was in hope that she had got rid for ever of her tormentor, but she was mistaken, for scarc was the week at an end befor the old woman appear befor her again, and repeat her threat of fall to work the next morning, unless she had someth given to her to buy tobacco. the next day and the next, and the next, goodi grope came on the same errand, and poor mary, who could ill-afford to suppli her constant with halfpence, at last exclaimed, ""i am sure the find of this treasur has not been ani good luck to us, but quit the contrary; and i wish we never had found it."" mari did not yet know how much she was to suffer on account of this unfortun"
edgeworth,children,"pot of gold coins. mr. hopkins, the agent, imagin that no one knew of the discoveri of this treasur but himself and these poor children; so, not be as honest as they were, he resolv to keep it for his own use. he was surpris some week afterward to receiv a letter from his employer, mr. harvey, demand from him the coin which had been discov at rossmor castle. hopkin had sold the gold coins, and some of the others; and he flatter himself that the children, and the young ladies, to whom he now found they had been shown, could not tell whether what they had seen were gold or not, and he was not in the least apprehens that those of henri the seventh reign should be reclaim from him as he thought they had escap attention. so he sent over the silver coin and other of littl"
edgeworth,children,"value, and apolog for his not have mention them before, by say that he consid them as mere rubbish. mr. harvey, in reply, observ that he could not consid as rubbish the gold coin which were amongst them when they were discovered; and he inquir whi these gold coins, and those of the reign of henri the seventh, were not now sent to him. mr. hopkin deni that he had ever receiv ani such; but he was thunderstruck when mr. harvey, in repli to this falsehood, sent him a list of the coin which the orphan had deposit with him, and exact draw of those that were missing. he inform him that this list and these draw came from two ladi who had seen the coin in question. mr. hopkin thought that he had no mean of escap but by bold persist in falsehood. he replied, that it was veri"
edgeworth,children,"like such coin had been found at rossmor castle, and that the ladi allud to had probabl seen them; but he posit declar that they never came to his hands; that he had restor all that were deposit with him; and that, as to the others, he suppos they must have been taken out of the pot by the children, or by edmund or mari on their way from the ladi hous to his. the orphan were shock and astonish when they heard, from isabella and caroline, the charg that was made against them. they look at one anoth in silenc for some moments. then peggi exclaimed--""sure! mr. hopkin has forgotten himself strangely. doe not he rememb edmund count the thing to him upon the great tabl in his hall, and we all stand by! i rememb it as well as if it was this instant."" ""and so do i,"""
edgeworth,children,"cri anne. ""and don't you recollect, mary, your pick out the gold ones, and tell mr. hopkin that they were gold; and he said you knew noth of the matter; and i was go to tell him that miss isabella had tri them, and knew that they were gold? but just then there came in some tenant to pay their rent, and he push us out, and twitch from my hand the piec of gold which i had taken up to show him the bright spot which miss isabella had clean by the stuff that she had pour on it? i believ he was afraid i should steal it; he twitch it from my hand in such a hurry. do, edmund; do, mary--let us go to him, and put him in mind of all this."" ""i'll go to him no more,"" said edmund, sturdily. ""he is a bad man--i'l never"
edgeworth,children,"go to him again. mary, don't be cast down--w have no need to be cast down--w are honest."" ""true,"" said mary; ""but is not it a hard case that we, who have lived, as my mother did all her life befor us, in peac and honesti with all the world, should now have our good name taken from us, when--"" mari voic falter and stopped. ""it can't be taken from us,"" cri edmund, ""poor orphan though we are, and he a rich gentleman, as he call himself. let him say and do what he will, he can't hurt our good name."" edmund was mistaken, alas! and mari had but too much reason for her fears. the affair was a great deal talk of; and the agent spare no pain to have the stori told his own way. the orphans, conscious of their own innocence, took no pain about the matter;"
edgeworth,children,"and the consequ was, that all who knew them well had no doubt of their honesty; but many, who knew noth of them, conclud that the agent must be in the right and the children in the wrong. the buzz of scandal went on for some time without reach their ears, becaus they live veri retiredly. but one day, when mari went to sell some stock of peggi knit at the neighbour fair, the man to whom she sold them bid her write her name on the back of a note, and exclaimed, on see it--""ho! ho! mistress; i'd not have had ani deal with you, had i known your name sooner. where the gold that you found at rossmor castle?"" it was in vain that mari relat the fact. she saw that she gain no belief, as her charact was not known to this man, or to ani of"
edgeworth,children,"those who were present. she left the fair as soon as she could; and though she struggl against it, she felt veri melancholy. still she exert herself everi day at her littl manufacture; and she endeavour to consol herself by reflect that she had two friend left who would not give up her character, and who continu steadili to protect her and her sisters. isabella and carolin everywher assert their belief in the integr of the orphans, but to prove it was in this instanc out of their power. mr. hopkins, the agent, and his friends, constant repeat that the gold coin were taken away in come from their hous to his; and these ladi were blame by mani peopl for continu to counten those that were, with great reason, suspect to be thieves. the orphan were in a wors condit than ever when the winter came on, and their"
edgeworth,children,"benefactress left the countri to spend some month in dublin. the old castle, it was true, was like to last through the winter, as the mason said; but though the want of a comfort hous to live in was, a littl while ago, the uppermost thing in mari thoughts, now it was not so. one night as mari was go to bed, she heard someon knock hard at the door. ""mary, are you up? let us in,"" cri a voice, which she knew to be the voic of betsi green, the postmast daughter, who live in the villag near them. she let betsi in, and ask what she could want at such a time of night. ""give me sixpence, and i'll tell you,"" said betsy; ""but waken ann and peggy. here a letter just come by post for you, and i step over to you with it; becaus i guess"
edgeworth,children,"you'd be glad to have it, see it is your brother handwriting."" peggi and ann were soon roused, when they heard that there was a letter from edmund. it was by one of his rush candl that mari read it; and the letter was as follows:-- ""dear mary, nancy, and littl peg,-- ""joy! joy!--i alway said the truth would come out at last; and that he could not take our good name from us. but i will not tell you how it all came about till we meet, which will be next week, as we are (i mean, master and mistress, and the young ladies--bless them!--and mr. gilbert and i) come down to the vicarag to keep christmas; and a happi christma tis like to be for honest folks. as for they that are not honest, it is not for them to expect to be happy, at christmas, or ani"
edgeworth,children,"other time. you shall know all when we meet. so, till then, fare ye well, dear mary, nancy, and littl peg. ""your joy and affection brother, edmund."" to comprehend whi edmund is joyful, our reader must be inform of certain thing which happen after isabella and carolin went to dublin. one morn they went with their father and mother to see the magnific librari of a nobleman, who took generous and polit pleasur in thus share the advantag of his wealth and station with all who had ani pretens to scienc or literature. know that the gentleman who was now come to see his librari was skill in antiquities, the nobleman open a drawer of medals, to ask his opinion concern the age of some coins, which he had late purchas at a high price. they were the veri same which the orphan had found at rossmor castle. isabella and"
edgeworth,children,"carolin knew them again instantly; and as the cross which isabella had made on each of them was still visibl through a magnifi glass, there could be no possibl of doubt. the nobleman, who was much interest both by the stori of these orphans, and the manner in which it was told to him, sent immedi for the person from whom he had purchas the coins. he was a jew broker. at first he refus to tell them from whom he got them, becaus he had bought them, he said, under a promis of secrecy. be further pressed, he acknowledg that it was made a condit in his bargain that he should not sell them to anyon in ireland, but that he had been tempt by the high price the present nobl possessor had offered. at last, when the jew was inform that the coin were stolen, and that he"
edgeworth,children,"would be proceed against as a receiv of stolen goods, if he did not confess the whole truth, he declar that he had purchas them from a gentleman, whom he had never seen befor or since; but he added, that he could swear to his person, if he saw him again. now, mr. hopkins, the agent, was at this time in dublin, and carolin father post the jew, the next day, in the back-parlour of a banker house, with whom mr. hopkin had, on this day, appoint to settl some accounts. mr. hopkin came--th jew knew him--swor that he was the man who had sold the coin to him; and thus the guilt of the agent and the innoc of the orphan were complet proved. a full account of all that happen was sent to england to mr. harvey, their landlord, and a few post afterward there came a letter"
edgeworth,children,"from him, contain a dismiss of the dishonest agent, and a reward for the honest and industri orphans. mr. harvey desir that mari and her sister might have the slate house, rent free, from this time forward, under the care of ladi isabella and caroline, as long as mari or her sister should carri on in it ani use business. this was the joy news which edmund had to tell his sisters. all the neighbour share in their joy, and the day of their remov from the ruin of rossmor castl to their new hous was the happiest of the christma holidays. they were not envi for their prosperity; becaus everybodi saw that it was the reward of their good conduct; everybodi except goodi grope. she exclaimed, as she wrung her hand with violent express of sorrow--""bad luck to me! bad luck to me!--whi didn't i go sooner to that"
edgeworth,children,"there castle? it is all luck, all luck in this world; but i never had no luck. think of the luck of these childer, that have found a pot of gold, and such great, grand friends, and a slate house, and all: and here am i, with scarc a rag to cover me, and not a potato to put into my mouth!--i, that have been look under ground all my day for treasure, not to have a halfpenni at the last, to buy me tobacco!"" ""that is the veri reason that you have not a halfpenny,"" said betsy. ""here mari has been work hard, and so have her two littl sister and her brother, for these five year past; and they have made money for themselv by their own industry--and friend too--not by luck, but by--"" ""phoo! phoo!"" interrupt goodi grope; ""don't be prating; don't i know as well as"

""no,"" repli the postmast daughter; ""this hous is given to them as a reward--that was the word in the letter; for i saw it. edmund show it to me, and will show it to anyon that want to see. this hous was given to them as a reward for their honesty.'"" lazi lawrence. in the pleasant valley of ashton there live an elder woman of the name of preston. she had a small neat cottage, and there was not a weed to be seen in her garden. it was upon her garden that she chiefli depend for support; it consist of strawberri beds, and one small border for flowers. the pink and rose she tie up in nice nosegays, and sent"

""but i could earn something, though, i say,"" cri jem, proudly; ""and i will earn something--if it be ever so little, it will be something--and i shall do my veri best; so i will."" ""that i'm sure of, my child,"" said his mother, draw him toward her"
edgeworth,children,"and kiss him; ""you were alway a good, industri lad, that i will say afor your face or behind your back;--but it won't do now--lightfoot must go."" jem turn away struggl to hide his tears, and went to bed without say a word more. but he knew that cri would do no good; so he present wipe his eyes, and lay awake, consid what he could possibl do to save the horse. ""if i get ever so little,"" he still said to himself, ""it will be something; and who know but landlord might then wait a bit longer? and we might make it all up in time; for a penni a day might come to two guinea in time."" but how to get the first penni was the question. then he recollect that one day, when he had been sent to clifton to sell some flowers, he had seen an"
edgeworth,children,"old woman with a board besid her cover with various sparkl stones, which peopl stop to look at as they passed, and he rememb that some peopl bought the stones; one paid twopence, anoth threepence, and anoth sixpenc for them; and jem heard her say that she got them amongst the neighbour rocks: so he thought that if he tri he might find some too, and sell them as she had done. earli in the morn he waken full of this scheme, jump up, dress himself, and, have given one look at poor lightfoot in his stable, set off to clifton in search of the old woman, to inquir where she found her sparkl stones. but it was too earli in the morning, the old woman was not at her seat; so he turn back again, disappointed. he did not wast his time wait for her, but saddl and bridl"
edgeworth,children,"lightfoot, and went to farmer truck for the giant strawberries. a great part of the morn was spent in put them into the ground; and, as soon as that was finished, he set out again in quest of the old woman, whom, to his great joy, he spi sit at her corner of the street with her board befor her. but this old woman was deaf and cross; and when at last jem made her hear his questions, he could get no answer from her, but that she found the fossil where he would never find ani more. ""but can't i look where you looked?"" ""look away, nobodi hinder you,"" repli the old woman; and these were the onli word she would say. jem was not, however, a boy to be easili discouraged; he went to the rocks, and walk slowli along, look at all the stone as he passed."
edgeworth,children,"present he came to a place where a number of men were at work loosen some larg rocks, and one amongst the workmen was stoop down look for someth veri eagerly; jem ran up, and ask if he could help him. ""yes,"" said the man, ""you can; i'v just dropped, amongst this heap of rubbish, a fine piec of crystal that i got to-day."" ""what kind of a look thing is it?"" said jem. ""white, and like glass,"" said the man, and went on work whilst jem look veri care over the heap of rubbish for a great while. ""come,"" said the man, ""it gone for ever; don't troubl yourself ani more, my boy."" ""it no trouble; i'll look a littl longer; we'll not give it up so soon,"" said jem; and after he had look a littl longer, he found the piec of crystal. ""thank'e,"" said the man, ""you"
edgeworth,children,"are a fine littl industri fellow."" jem, encourag by the tone of voic in which the man spoke this, ventur to ask him the same question which he had ask the old woman. ""one good turn deserv another,"" said the man; ""we are go to dinner just now, and shall leav off work--wait for me here, and i'll make it worth your while."" jem waited; and, as he was veri attent observ how the workmen went on with their work, he heard somebodi near him give a great yawn, and, turn round, he saw stretch upon the grass, besid the river, a boy about his own age, who, in the villag of ashton, as he knew, went by the name of lazi lawrence--a name which he most just deserved, for he never did anyth from morn to night. he neither work nor played, but saunter or loung about restless and"
edgeworth,children,"yawning. his father was an ale-hous keeper, and be general drunk, could take no care of his son; so that lazi lawrenc grew everi day wors and worse. however, some of the neighbour said that he was a good natured, poor fellow enough, and would never do anyon harm but himself; whilst others, who were wiser, often shook their heads, and told him that idl was the root of all evil. ""what, lawrence!"" cri jem to him, when he saw him lie upon the grass; ""what, are you asleep?"" ""not quite."" ""are you awake?"" ""not quite."" ""what are you do there?"" ""nothing."" ""what are you think of?"" ""nothing."" ""what make you lie there?"" ""i don't know--becaus i can't find anybodi to play with me to-day. will you come and play?"" ""no, i can't; i'm busy."" ""busy,"" cri lawrence, stretch himself, ""you are alway busy. i would not be you for"
edgeworth,children,"the world, to have so much to do always."" ""and i,"" said jem, laughing, ""would not be you for the world, to have noth to do."" they then parted, for the workman just then call jem to follow him. he took him home to his own house, and show him a parcel of fossils, which he had gathered, he said, on purpos to sell, but had never had time enough to sell them. now, however, he set about the task; and have pick out those which he judg to be the best, he put them in a small basket, and gave them to jem to sell, upon condit that he should bring him half of what he got. jem, pleas to be employed, was readi to agre to what the man proposed, provid his mother had no objection. when he went home to dinner, he told his mother his scheme,"
edgeworth,children,"and she smiled, and said he might do as he pleased; for she was not afraid of his be from home. ""you are not an idl boy,"" said she; ""so there is littl danger of your get into ani mischief."" accord jem that even took his stand, with his littl basket, upon the bank of the river, just at the place where peopl land from a ferry- boat, and the walk turn to the wells, and number of peopl perpetu pass to drink the waters. he chose his place well, and wait near all the evening, offer his fossil with great assidu to everi passenger; but not one person bought any. ""hallo!"" cri some sailors, who had just row a boat to land, ""bear a hand here, will you, my littl fellow, and carri these parcel for us into yonder house?"" jem ran down immedi for the parcels, and did"
edgeworth,children,"what he was ask to do so quickly, and with so much good-will, that the master of the boat took notic of him, and, when he was go away, stop to ask him what he had got in his littl basket; and when he saw that they were fossils, he immedi told jem to follow him, for that he was go to carri some shell he had brought from abroad to a ladi in the neighbourhood who was make a grotto. ""she will veri like buy your stone into the bargain. come along, my lad; we can but try."" the ladi live but a veri littl way off, so that they were soon at her house. she was alon in her parlour, and was sort a bundl of feather of differ colours; they lay on a sheet of pasteboard upon a window seat, and it happen that as the sailor"
edgeworth,children,"was bustl round the tabl to show off his shells, he knock down the sheet of pasteboard, and scatter all the feathers. the ladi look veri sorry, which jem observing, he took the opportunity, whilst she was busi look over the sailor bag of shells, to gather togeth all the feathers, and sort them accord to their differ colours, as he had seen them sort when he first came into the room. ""where is the littl boy you brought with you? i thought i saw him here just now."" ""and here i am, ma'am,"" cri jem, creep from under the table, with some few remain feather which he had pick from the carpet; ""i thought,"" ad he, point to the others, ""i had better be do someth than stand idle, ma'am."" she smiled, and, pleas with his activ and simplicity, began to ask him sever questions; such as who he"
edgeworth,children,"was, where he lived, what employ he had, and how much a day he earn by gather fossils. ""this is the first day i ever tried,"" said jem; ""i never sold ani yet, and if you don't buy em now, ma'am, i'm afraid nobodi els will; for i'v ask everybodi else."" ""come, then,"" said the lady, laughing, ""if that is the case, i think i had better buy them all."" so, empti all the fossil out of his basket, she put half a crown into it. jem eye sparkl with joy. ""oh, thank you, ma'am,"" said he, ""i will be sure and bring you as mani more, to-morrow."" ""yes, but i don't promis you,"" said she, ""to give you half a crown, to- morrow."" ""but, perhaps, though you don't promis it, you will."" ""no,"" said the lady, ""do not deceiv yourself; i assur you that i will not. that, instead"
edgeworth,children,"of encourag you to be industrious, would teach you to be idle."" jem did not quit understand what she meant by this, but answered, ""i'm sure i don't wish to be idle; what i want is to earn someth everi day, if i know how; i'm sure i don't wish to be idle. if you knew all, you'd know i did not."" ""how do you mean, if i knew all?"" ""why, i mean, if you knew about lightfoot."" ""who lightfoot?"" ""why, mammi horse,"" ad jem, look out of the window; ""i must make hast home, and feed him afor it get dark; he'll wonder what gone with me."" ""let him wonder a few minut longer,"" said the lady, ""and tell me the rest of your story."" ""i'v no story, ma'am, to tell, but as how mammi say he must go to the fair monday fortnight, to be sold, if she"
edgeworth,children,"can't get the two guinea for her rent; and i should be main sorri to part with him, for i love him, and he love me; so i'll work for him, i will, all i can. to be sure, as mammi says, i have no chance, such a littl fellow as i am, of earn two guinea afor monday fortnight."" ""but are you will earnest to work?"" said the lady; ""you know there is a great deal of differ between pick up a few stones, and work steadili everi day, and all day long."" ""but,"" said jem, ""i would work everi day, and all day long."" ""then,"" said the lady, ""i will give you work. come here, to-morrow morning, and my garden will set you to weed the shrubberies, and i will pay you sixpenc a day. remember, you must be at the gate by six o'clock."" jem bowed, thank"
edgeworth,children,"her, and went away. it was late in the evening, and jem was impati to get home to feed lightfoot; yet he recollect that he had promis the man who had trust him to sell the fossils, that he would bring him half of what he got for them; so he thought that he had better go to him directly; and away he went, run along by the watersid about a quarter of a mile, till he came to the man house. he was just come home from work, and was surpris when jem show him the half-crown, saying, ""look what i got for the stones; you are to have half, you know."" ""no,"" said the man, when he had heard his story, ""i shall not take half of that; it was given to you. i expect but a shill at the most, and the half of that is but"
edgeworth,children,"sixpence, and that i'll take. wife, give the lad two shillings, and take this half-crown."" so the wife open an old glove, and took out two shillings; and the man, as she open the glove, put in his fingers, and took out a littl silver penny. ""there, he shall have that into the bargain for his honesty--honesti is the best policy-- there a lucki penni for you, that i'v kept ever sinc i can remember."" ""don't you ever go to part with it, do ye hear!"" cri the woman. ""let him do what he will with it, wife,"" said the man. ""but,"" argu the wife, ""anoth penni would do just as well to buy gingerbread; and that what it will go for."" ""no, that it shall not, i promis you,"" said jem; and so he ran away home, fed lightfoot, stroke him, went to bed, jump up at five o'clock"
edgeworth,children,"in the morning, and went sing to work as gay as a lark. four day he work ""everi day and all day long""; and everi even the lady, when she came out to walk in her gardens, look at his work. at last she said to her gardener, ""this littl boy work veri hard."" ""never had so good a littl boy about the grounds,"" said the gardener; ""he alway at his work, let me come by when i will, and he has got twice as much done as anoth would do; yes, twice as much, ma'am; for look here--h began at this ere rose-bush, and now he got to where you stand, ma'am; and here is the day work that t'other boy, and he three year older too, did to-day--i say, measur jem fairly, and it twice as much, i'm sure."" ""well,"" said the ladi to her gardener, ""show me"
edgeworth,children,"how much is a fair day work for a boy of his age."" ""come at six o'clock and go at six? why, about this much, ma'am,"" said the gardener, mark off a piec of the border with his spade. ""then, littl boy,"" said the lady, ""so much shall be your task everi day. the garden will mark it off for you; and when you'v done, the rest of the day you may do what you please."" jem was extrem glad of this; and the next day he had finish his task by four o'clock; so that he had all the rest of the even to himself. he was as fond of play as ani littl boy could be; and when he was at it he play with all the eager and gaieti imaginable; so as soon as he had finish his task, fed lightfoot, and put by the sixpenc he"
edgeworth,children,"had earn that day, he ran to the playground in the village, where he found a parti of boy playing, and amongst them lazi lawrence, who inde was not playing, but loung upon a gate, with his thumb in his mouth. the rest were play at cricket. jem join them, and was the merriest and most activ amongst them; till, at last, when quit out of breath with running, he was oblig to give up to rest himself, and sat down upon the stile, close to the gate on which lazi lawrenc was swinging. ""and whi don't you play, lawrence?"" said he. ""i'm tired,"" said lawrence. ""tire of what?"" ""i don't know well what tire me; grandmoth say i'm ill, and i must take something--i don't know what ail me."" ""oh, pugh! take a good race--one, two, three, and away--and you'll find yourself as well as ever. come, run--one, two,"
edgeworth,children,"three, and away."" ""ah, no, i can't run, indeed,"" said he, hang back heavily; ""you know i can play all day long if i like it, so i don't mind play as you do, who have onli one hour for it."" ""so much the wors for you. come, now, i'm quit fresh again, will you have one game at ball? do."" ""no, i tell you i can't; i'm as tire as if i had been work all day long as hard as a horse."" ""ten time more,"" said jem, ""for i have been work all day long, as hard as a horse, and yet you see i'm not a bit tired, onli a littl out of breath just now."" ""that veri odd,"" said lawrence, and yawned, for want of some better answer; then take out a hand of halfpence,--""se what i got from father today, becaus i ask him just"
edgeworth,children,"at the right time, when he had drunk a glass or two; then i can get anyth i want out of him--see! a penny, twopence, threepence, fourpence--ther eightpenc in all; would not you be happi if you had eightpence?"" ""why, i don't know,"" said jem, laughing, ""for you don't seem happy, and you have eightpence."" ""that doe not signify, though. i'm sure you onli say that becaus you envi me. you don't know what it is to have eightpence. you never had more than twopenc or threepenc at a time in all your life."" jem smiled. ""oh, as to that,"" said he, ""you are mistaken, for i have at this veri time more than twopence, threepence, or eightpenc either. i have--let me--see--stones, two shillings; then five day work--that five sixpences, that two shill and sixpence; in all, make four shill and sixpence; and my silver penny, is four and sevenpence--four"
edgeworth,children,"and sevenpence!"" ""you have not!"" said lawrence, rous so as absolut to stand upright, ""four and sevenpence, have you? show it me, and then i'll believ you."" ""follow me, then,"" cri jem, ""and i'll soon make you believ me; come."" ""is it far?"" said lawrence, follow half-running, half-hobbling, till he came to the stable, where jem show him his treasure. ""and how did you come by it--honestly?"" ""honestly! to be sure i did; i earn it all."" ""lord bless me, earn it! well, i'v a great mind to work; but then it such hot weather, besides, grandmoth say i'm not strong enough yet for hard work; and besides, i know how to coax daddi out of money when i want it, so i need not work. but four and sevenpence; let see, what will you do with it all?"" ""that a secret,"" said jem, look great. ""i can guess; i"
edgeworth,children,"know what i'd do with it if it was mine. first, i'd buy pocket of gingerbread; then i'd buy ever so mani appl and nuts. don't you love nuts? i'd buy nut enough to last me from this time to christmas, and i'd make littl newton crack em for me, for that the worst of nuts; there the troubl of crack em."" ""well, you never deserv to have a nut."" ""but you'll give me some of yours,"" said lawrence, in a fawn tone; for he thought it easier to coax than to work--""you'l give me some of your good things, won't you?"" ""i shall not have ani of those good things,"" said jem. ""then, what will you do with all your money?"" ""oh, i know veri well what to do with it; but, as i told you, that a secret, and i sha'n't tell it anybody. come now, let go"
edgeworth,children,"back and play- -their game up, i daresay."" lawrenc went back with him, full of curiosity, and out of humour with himself and his eightpence. ""if i had four and sevenpence,"" said he to himself, ""i certain should be happy!"" the next day, as usual, jem jump up befor six o'clock and went to his work, whilst lazi lawrenc saunter about without know what to do with himself. in the cours of two day he laid out sixpenc of his money in appl and gingerbread; and as long as these lasted, he found himself well receiv by his companions; but, at length the third day he spent his last halfpenny, and when it was gone, unfortun some nut tempt him veri much, but he had no money to pay for them; so he ran home to coax his father, as he call it. when he got home he heard his"
edgeworth,children,"father talk veri loud, and at first he thought he was drunk; but when he open the kitchen door, he saw that he was not drunk, but angry. ""you lazi dog!"" cri he, turn sudden upon lawrence, and gave him such a violent box on the ear as made the light flash from his eyes; ""you lazi dog! see what you'v done for me--look!--look, look, i say!"" lawrenc look as soon as he came to the use of his senses, and with fear, amaz and remorse, beheld at least a dozen bottl burst, and the fine worcestershir cider stream over the floor. ""now, did not i order you three day ago to carri these bottl to the cellar, and did not i charg you to wire the corks? answer me, you lazi rascal; did not i?"" ""yes,"" said lawrence, scratch his head. ""and whi was not it done, i ask"
edgeworth,children,"you?"" cri his father, with renew anger, as anoth bottl burst at the moment. ""what do you stand there for, you lazi brat? whi don't you move, i say? no, no,"" catch hold of him, ""i believ you can't move; but i'll make you."" and he shook him till lawrenc was so giddi he could not stand. ""what had you to think of? what had you to do all day long that you could not carri my cider, my worcestershir cider, to the cellar when i bid you? but go, you'll never be good for anything; you are such a lazi rascal--get out of my sight!"" so saying, he push him out of the hous door, and lawrenc sneak off, see that this was no time to make his petit for halfpence. the next day he saw the nut again, and wish for them more than ever, he went home,"
edgeworth,children,"in hope that his father, as he said to himself, would be in a better humour. but the cider was still fresh in his recollection; and the moment lawrenc began to whisper the word ""halfpenny"" in his ear, his father swore, with a loud oath, ""i will not give you a halfpenny, no, not a farthing, for a month to come. if you want money, go work for it; i'v had enough of your laziness--go work!"" at these terribl word lawrenc burst into tears, and, go to the side of a ditch, sat down and cri for an hour; and when he had cri till he could cri no more, he exert himself so far as to empti his pockets, to see whether there might not happen to be one halfpenni left; and, to his great joy, in the farthest corner of his pocket one halfpenni was found. with this"
edgeworth,children,"he proceed to the fruit woman stall. she was busi weigh out some plums, so he was oblig to wait; and whilst he was wait he heard some peopl near him talk and laugh veri loud. the fruit woman stall was at the gate of an inn yard; and peep through the gate in this yard, lawrenc saw a postilion and a stabl boy, about his own size, play at pitch farthing. he stood by watch them for a few minutes. ""i began but with one halfpenny,"" cri the stabl boy, with an oath, ""and now i'v got twopence!"" ad he, jingl the halfpenc in his waistcoat pocket. lawrenc was move at the sound, and said to himself, ""if _i_ begin with one halfpenni i may end, like him, with have twopence; and it is easier to play at pitch farth than to work."" so he step forward, present his"
edgeworth,children,"halfpenny, offer to toss up with the stabl boy, who, after look him full in the face, accept the proposal, and threw his halfpenni into the air. ""head or tail?"" cri he. ""head,"" repli lawrence, and it came up head. he seiz the penny, surpris at his own success, and would have gone instant to have laid it out in nuts; but the stabl boy stop him, and tempt him to throw again. this time lawrenc lost; he threw again and won; and so he went on, sometim losing, but most frequent winning, till half the morn was lost. at last, however, find himself the master of three halfpence, said he would play no more. the stabl boy, grumbling, swore he would have his reveng anoth time, and lawrenc went and bought his nuts. ""it is a good thing,"" said he to himself, ""to play at pitch farthing; the next"
edgeworth,children,"time i want a halfpenni i'll not ask my father for it, nor go to work neither."" satisfi with this resolution, he sat down to crack his nut at his leisure, upon the hors block in the inn yard. here, whilst he ate, he overheard the convers of the stabl boy and postilions. at first their shock oath and loud wrangl frighten and shock him; for lawrence, though lazy, had not yet learn to be a wick boy. but, by degrees, he was accustom to the swear and quarrelling, and took a delight and interest in their disput and battles. as this was an amus which he could enjoy without ani sort of exertion, he soon grew so fond of it, that everi day he return to the stabl yard, and the hors block becam his constant seat. here he found some relief from the insupport fatigu of do nothing,"
edgeworth,children,"and here, hour after hour, with his elbow on his knees, and his head on his hands, he sat, the spectat of wickedness. gaming, cheat and lie soon becam familiar to him; and, to complet his ruin, he form a sudden and close intimaci with the stabl boy (a veri bad boy) with whom he had first begun to game. the consequ of this intimaci we shall present see. but it is now time to inquir what littl jem had been do all this while. one day, after jem had finish his task, the garden ask him to stay a littl while, to help him to carri some geranium pot into the hall. jem, alway activ and obliging, readili stay from play, and was carri in a heavi flower pot, when his mistress cross the hall. ""what a terribl litter!"" said she, ""you are make here--whi don't you wipe your"
edgeworth,children,"shoe upon the mat?"" jem turn to look for the mat, but he saw none. ""oh,"" said the ladi recollect herself, ""i can't blame you, for there is no mat."" ""no, ma'am,"" said the gardener, ""nor i don't know when, if ever, the man will bring home those mat you bespoke, ma'am."" ""i am veri sorri to hear that,"" said the lady; ""i wish we could find somebodi who would do them, if he can't. i should not care what sort of mat they were, so that one could wipe one feet on them."" jem, as he was sweep away the litter, when he heard these last words, said to himself, ""perhap i could make a mat."" and all the way home, as he trudg along whistling, he was think over a scheme for make mats, which, howev bold it may appear, he did not despair of executing, with patienc"
edgeworth,children,"and industry. mani were the difficulti which his ""prophet eye"" foresaw; but he felt within himself that spirit which spur men on to great enterprises, and make them ""trampl on impossibilities."" in the first place, he recollect that he had seen lazi lawrence, whilst he loung upon the gate, twist a bit of heath into differ shapes; and he thought, that if he could find some way of plait heath firm together, it would make a veri pretti green soft mat, which would do veri well for one to wipe one shoe on. about a mile from his mother house, on the common which jem rode over when he went to farmer truck for the giant strawberries, he rememb to have seen a great quantiti of this heath; and, as it was now onli six o'clock in the evening, he knew that he should have time to feed lightfoot, stroke"
edgeworth,children,"him, go to the common, return, and make one trial of his skill befor he went to bed. lightfoot carri him swift to the common, and there jem gather as much of the heath as he thought he should want. but what toil! what time! what pain did it cost him, befor he could make anyth like a mat! twenti time he was readi to throw asid the heath, and give up his project, from impati of repeat disappointments. but still he persevered. noth truli great can be accomplish without toil and time. two hour he work befor he went to bed. all his play hour the next day he spent at his mat; which, in all, made five hour of fruitless attempts. the sixth, however, repaid him for the labour of the other five. he conquer his grand difficulti of fasten the heath substanti together, and at length complet"
edgeworth,children,"finish a mat, which far surpass his most sanguin expectations. he was extrem happy-- sang, danc round it--whistled--look at it again and again, and could hard leav off look at it when it was time to go to bed. he laid it by his bedside, that he might see it the moment he awok in the morning. and now came the grand pleasur of carri it to his mistress. she look fulli as much surpris as he expected, when she saw it, and when she heard who made it. after have duli admir it, she ask how much he expect for his mat. ""expect!--nothing, ma'am,"" said jem; ""i meant to give it you, if you'd have it; i did not mean to sell it. i made it in my play hours, i was veri happi in make it; and i'm veri glad, too, that you like it; and if you"
edgeworth,children,"pleas to keep it, ma'am, that all."" ""but that not all,"" said the lady. ""spend your time no more in weed in my garden, you can employ yourself much better; you shall have the reward of your ingenu as well as of your industry. make as mani more such mat as you can, and i will take care and dispos of them for you."" ""thank'e, ma'am,"" said jem, make his best bow, for he thought by the ladi look that she meant to do him a favour, though he repeat to himself, ""dispos of them, what doe that mean?"" the next day he went to work to make more mats, and he soon learn to make them so well and quickly, that he was surpris at his own success. in everi one he made he found less difficulty, so that, instead of make two, he could soon make four in"
edgeworth,children,"a day. in a fortnight he made eighteen. it was saturday night when he finished, and he carried, at three journeys, his eighteen mat to his mistress house; pile them all up in the hall, and stood with his hat off, with a look of proud humility, besid the pile, wait for his mistress appearance. present a folding-door, at one end of the hall, opened, and he saw his mistress, with a great mani gentlemen and ladies, rise from sever tables. ""oh! there is my littl boy and his mats,"" cri the lady; and, follow by all the rest of the company, she came into the hall. jem modest retir whilst they look at his mats; but in a minut or two his mistress beckon to him, and when he came into the middl of the circle, he saw that his pile of mat had disappeared. ""well,"" said the lady,"
edgeworth,children,"smiling, ""what do you see that make you look so surprised?"" ""that all my mat are gone,"" said jem; ""but you are veri welcome."" ""are we?"" said the lady, ""well, take up your hat and go home then, for you see that it is get late, and you know lightfoot will wonder what becom of you."" jem turn round to take up his hat, which he had left on the floor. but how his counten changed! the hat was heavi with shillings. everyon who had taken a mat had put in two shillings; so that for the eighteen mat he had got thirty-six shillings. ""thirty-six shillings,"" said the lady; ""five and sevenp i think you told me you had earn already--how much doe that make? i must add, i believe, one other sixpenc to make out your two guineas."" ""two guineas!"" exclaim jem, now quit conquer his bashfulness, for at"

""well, but sinc i did say that i should have no object to tri him, i shall keep my word; let him come to-morrow. let them both have a fair trial, and at the end of the month i can decid which i like best, and which we had better keep."" dismiss with these orders, mrs. pomfret hasten to report all that had pass to the cook, like a favourit minister, proud to display the extent of her secret influence. in the morn felix, the cook nephew, arrived; and, the moment he came into the kitchen, everi eye, even the scullion's, was fix upon him with approbation, and afterward glanc upon franklin with contempt--contempt which franklin could not endur without some confusion, though"
edgeworth,children,"quit unconsci of have deserv it; nor, upon the most imparti and cool self-examination, could he comprehend the justic of his judges. he perceiv indeed--for the comparison were minut made in audibl and scorn whispers--that felix was a much handsomer, or as the kitchen maid express it, a much more genteel gentleman look like sort of person than he was; and he was made to understand, that he want a frill to his shirt, a cravat, a pair of thin shoes, and, abov all, shoe strings, besid other nameless advantages, which just made his rival the admir of the kitchen. however, upon call to mind all that his friend mr. spencer had ever said to him, he could not recollect his have warn him that shoe string were indispens requisit to the charact of a good servant; so that he could onli comfort himself with resolving, if possible, to make"
edgeworth,children,"amend for these deficiencies, and to dissip the prejudic which he saw were form against him, by the strictest adher to all that his tutor had taught him to be his duty. he hope to secur the approb of his mistress by scrupul obedi to all her commands, and faith care of all that belong to her. at the same time he flatter himself he should win the goodwil of his fellow servant by show a constant desir to oblig them. he pursu this plan of conduct steadili for near three weeks, and found that he succeed beyond his expect in pleas his mistress; but unfortun he found it more difficult to pleas his fellow servants, and he sometim offend when he least expect it. he had made great progress in the affect of corkscrew, the butler, by work inde veri hard for him, and do everi day at least"
edgeworth,children,"half his business. but one unfortun night the butler was gone out; the bell rang: he went upstairs; and his mistress ask where corkscrew was, he answer that he was gone out. ""where to!"" said his mistress. ""i don't know,"" answer franklin. and, as he had told exact the truth, and meant to do no harm, he was surprised, at the butler return, when he repeat to him what had passed, at receiv a sudden box on the ear, and the appel of a mischievous, impertinent, mean-spirit brat. ""mischievous, impertinent, mean!"" repeat franklin to himself; but, look in the butler face, which was a deeper scarlet than usual, he judg that he was far from sober, and did not doubt but that the next morning, when he came to the use of his reason, he would be sensibl of his injustice, and apolog for his box of the ear. but"
edgeworth,children,"no apolog come all day, franklin at last ventur to request an explanation, or rather, to ask what he had best do on the next occasion. ""why,"" said corkscrew, ""when mistress ask for me, how came you to say i was gone out?"" ""because, you know, i saw you go out."" ""and when she ask you where i was gone, how came you to say that you did not know?"" ""because, indeed, i did not."" ""you are a stupid blockhead! could you not say i was gone to the washerwoman's?"" ""but were you?"" said franklin. ""was i?"" cri corkscrew, and look as if he would have struck him again; ""how dare you give me the lie, mr. hypocrite? you would be readi enough, i'll be bound, to make excus for yourself. whi are not mistress clog cleaned? go along and blacken em, this minute, and send felix to me."" from"
edgeworth,children,"this time forward felix alon was privileg to enter the butler pantry. felix becam the favourit of corkscrew; and, though franklin by no mean sought to pri into the mysteri of their privat conferences, nor ever enter without knock at the door, yet it was his fate onc to be sent of a messag at an unlucki time; and, as the door was half open, he could not avoid see felix drink a bumper of red liquor, which he could not help suspect to be wine; and, as the decanter, which usual went upstair after dinner, was at this time in the butler grasp, without ani stopper in it, he was involuntarili forc to suspect they were drink his mistress wine. nor were the bumper of port the onli unlaw reward which felix received: his aunt, the cook, had occas for his assistance, and she had mani delici douceur in"
edgeworth,children,"her gift. mani a hand of currants, mani a half-custard, mani a triangular remnant of pie, besid the choic of his own meal at breakfast, dinner and supper, fell to the share of the favourit felix; whilst franklin was neglected, though he took the utmost pain to pleas the cook in all honour service, and, when she was hot, angry, or hurried, he was alway at hand to help her; and in the hour of adversity, when the clock struck five, and no dinner was dished, and no kitchen maid with twenti pair of hand was to be had, franklin would answer to her call, with flower to garnish her dishes, and presenc of mind to know, in the midst of the commotion, where everyth that was want was to be found; so that, quick as lightning, all difficulti vanish befor him. yet when the danger was over, and the"
edgeworth,children,"hour of advers had past, the ungrat cook would forget her benefactor, and, when it came to his supper time, would throw him, with a careless that touch him sensibly, anyth which the other servant were too nice to eat. all this franklin bore with fortitude; nor did he envi felix the dainti which he ate, sometim close besid him: ""for,"" said he to himself, ""i have a clear conscience, and that is more than felix can have. i know how he win cook favour too well, and i fanci i know how i have offend her; for sinc the day i saw the basket, she has done noth but huff me."" the histori of the basket was this. mrs. pomfret, the housekeeper, had sever times, direct and indirectly, given the world below to understand that she and her mistress thought there was a prodigi quantiti of meat eaten of"
edgeworth,children,"late. now, when she spoke, it was usual at dinner time; she alway looked, or franklin imagin that she looked, suspici at him. other peopl look more maliciously; but, as he felt himself perfect innocent, he went on eat his dinner in silence. but at length it was time to explain. one sunday there appear a handsom sirloin of beef, which befor noon on monday had shrunk almost to the bare bone, and present such a deplor spectacl to the open eye of mrs. pomfret that her long smother indign burst forth, and she bold declar she was now certain there had been foul play, and she would have the beef found, or she would know why. she spoke, but no beef appeared, till franklin, with a look of sudden recollection, cried, ""did not i see someth like a piec of beef in a basket in the dairy?--i think--"" the"
edgeworth,children,"cook, as if somebodi had smote her a dead blow, grew pale; but, sudden recov the use of her speech, turn upon franklin, and, with a voic of thunder, gave him the lie direct; and forthwith, take mrs. pomfret by the ruffle, led the way to the dairy, declar she could defi the world--""that so she could, and would."" ""there, ma'am,"" said she kick an empti basket which lay on the floor--""ther malic for you. ask him whi he don't show you the beef in the basket."" ""i thought i saw--"" poor franklin began. ""you thought you saw!"" cri the cook, come close up to him with kimbo arms, and look like a dragon; ""and pray, sir, what busi has such a one as you to think you see? and pray, ma'am, will you be pleas to speak--perhaps, ma'am, he'll condescend to obey you--ma'am, will you be pleas to forbid"
edgeworth,children,"him my dairy? for here he come pri and spi about; and how, ma'am, am i to answer for my butter and cream, or anyth at all? i'm sure it what i can't pretend to, unless you do me the justic to forbid him my places."" mrs. pomfret, whose eye were blind by her prejudic against the folk of the ""villaintrop society,"" and also by her secret jealousi of a boy whom she deem to be a grow favourit of her mistress', took part with the cook, and ended, as she began, with a firm persuas that franklin was the guilti person. ""let him alone, let him alone!"" said she; ""he has as mani turn and wind as a hare; but we shall catch him yet, i'll be bound, in some of his doublings. i knew the natur of him well enough, from the first time i ever set my"
edgeworth,children,"eye upon him; but mistress shall have her own way, and see the end of it."" these words, and the bitter sens of injustice, drew tear at length fast down the proud cheek of franklin, which might possibl have touch mrs. pomfret, if felix, with a sneer, had not call them crocodil tears. ""felix, too!"" thought he; ""this is too much."" in fact, felix had till now profess himself his firm ally, and had on his part receiv from franklin unequivoc proof of friendship; for it must be told that everi other morning, when it was felix turn to get breakfast, felix never was up in decent time, and must inevit have come to public disgrac if franklin had not got all the breakfast thing readi for him, the bread and butter spread, and the toast toasted; and had not, moreover, regularly, when the clock struck eight, and mrs. pomfret"
edgeworth,children,"foot was heard overhead, run to call the sleep felix, and help him constant through the hurri of get dress one instant befor the housekeep came downstairs. all this could not but be present to his memory; but, seem to reproach him, franklin wipe away his crocodil tears, and preserv a magnanim silence. the hour of retribut was, however, not so far off as felix imagined. cun peopl may go on clever in their devic for some time; but although they may escap once, twice, perhap ninety-nin times, what doe that signify?--for the hundredth time they come to shame, and lose all their character. grown bold by frequent success, felix becam more careless in his operations; and it happen that one day he met his mistress full in the passage, as he was go on one of the cook secret errands. ""where are you going, felix?"" said his mistress. ""to"
edgeworth,children,"the washerwoman's, ma'am,"" answer he, with his usual effrontery. ""veri well,"" said she. ""call at the booksel in--stay, i must write down the direction. pomfret,"" said she, open the housekeep room door, ""have you a bit of paper?"" pomfret came with the writing-paper, and look veri angri to see that felix was go out without her knowledge; so, while mrs. churchil was write the direction, she stood talk to him about it; whilst he, in the greatest terror imaginable, look up in her face as she spoke; but was all the time intent on parri on the other side the attack of a littl french dog of his mistress', which, unluckili for him, had follow her into the passage. manchon was extrem fond of felix, who, by way of pleas his mistress, had paid most assidu court to her dog; yet now his caress were rather troublesome. manchon leap up,"
edgeworth,children,"and was not to be rebuffed. ""poor fellow--poor fellow--down! down! poor fellow!"" cri felix, and put him away. but manchon leap up again, and began smell near the fatal pocket in a most alarm manner. ""you will see by this direct where you are to go,"" said his mistress. ""manchon, come here--and you will be so good as to bring me--down! down! manchon, be quiet!"" but manchon knew better--h had now got his head into felix pocket, and would not be quiet till he had drawn from thence, rustl out of it brown paper, half a cold turkey, which had been miss sinc morning. ""mi cold turkey, as i'm alive!"" exclaim the housekeeper, dart upon it with horror and amazement. ""what is all this?"" said mrs. churchill, in a compos voice. ""i don't know, ma'am,"" answer felix, so confus that he knew not what to say; ""but--"" ""but what?"" cri"
edgeworth,children,"mrs. pomfret, indign flash from her eyes. ""but what?"" repeat his mistress, wait for his repli with a calm air of attention, which still more disconcert felix; for, though with an angri person he might have some chanc of escape, he knew that he could not invent ani excus in such circumstances, which could stand the examin of a person in her sober senses. he was struck dumb. ""speak,"" said mrs. churchill, in a still lower tone; ""i am readi to hear all you have to say. in my hous everybodi shall have justice; speak-- but what?"" ""but,"" stammer felix; and, after in vain attempt to equivocate, confess that he was go to take the turkey to his cousin's; but he threw all the blame upon his aunt, the cook, who, he said, had order him upon this expedition. the cook was now summoned; but she total deni all knowledg"
edgeworth,children,"of the affair, with the same violenc with which she had late confound franklin about the beef in the basket; not entirely, however, with the same success; for felix, perceiv by his mistress eye that she was on the point of desir him to leav the hous immediately; and not be veri will to leav a place in which he had live so well with the butler, did not hesit to confront his aunt with assur equal to her own. he knew how to bring his charg home to her. he produc a note in her own handwriting, the purport of which was to request her cousin accept of ""some delic cold turkey,"" and to beg she would send her, by the return of the bearer, a littl of her cherry-brandy. mrs. churchil coolli wrote upon the back of the note her cook discharge, and inform felix she had no"
edgeworth,children,"further occas for his services, but, upon his plead with mani tears, which franklin did not call crocodil tears, that he was so young, that he was under the dominion of his aunt, he touch mrs. pomfret compassion, and she obtain for him permiss to stay till the end of the month, to give him yet a chanc of redeem his character. mrs. pomfret now see how far she had been impos upon, resolved, for the future, to be more upon her guard with felix, and felt that she had treat franklin with great injustice, when she accus him of malpractic about the sirloin of beef. good people, when they are made sensibl that they have treat anyon with injustice, are impati to have an opportun to rectifi their mistake; and mrs. pomfret was now prepar to see everyth which franklin did in the most favour point of view; especi"
edgeworth,children,"as the next day she discov that it was he who everi morn boil the water for her tea, and butter her toast--servic for which she had alway thought she was indebt to felix. besides, she had rate felix abil veri highly, becaus he made up her week account for her; but unluckili once, when franklin was out of the way, and she brought a bill in a hurri to her favourit to cast up, she discov that he did not know how to cast up pounds, shill and pence, and he was oblig to confess that she must wait till franklin came home. but, pass over a number of small incid which gradual unfold the charact of the two boys, we must proceed to a more serious affair. corkscrew frequently, after he had finish take away supper, and after the housekeep was gone to bed, salli forth to a"
edgeworth,children,"neighbour alehous to drink with his friends. the alehous was kept by that cousin of felix's, who was so fond of ""delic cold turkey,"" and who had such choic cherry-brandy. corkscrew kept the key of the hous door, so that he could return home whenev he thought proper; and, if he should by accid be call for by his mistress after supper, felix knew where to find him, and did not scrupl to make ani of those excus which poor franklin had too much integr to use. all these precaut taken, the butler was at liberti to indulg his favourit passion, which so increas with indulgence, that his wage were by no mean suffici to support him in this way of life. everi day he felt less resolut to break through his bad habits; for everi day drink becam more necessari to him. his health was ruined. with a red,"
edgeworth,children,"pimpled, bloat face, emaci legs, and a swelled, diseas body, he appear the victim of intoxication. in the morning, when he got up, his hand trembled, his spirit flagged, he could do noth until he had taken a dram--an oper which he was oblig to repeat sever time in the cours of the day, as all those wretch peopl must who onc acquir this habit. he had run up a long bill at the alehous which he frequented; and the landlord, who grew urgent for his money, refus to give further credit. one night, when corkscrew had drunk enough onli to make him fretful, he lean with his elbow surlili upon the table, began to quarrel with the landlord, and swore that he had not of late treat him like a gentleman. to which the landlord coolli replied, ""that as long as he had paid like a gentleman, he had"
edgeworth,children,"been treat like one, and that was as much as anyon could expect, or, at ani rate, as much as anyon would meet with in this world."" for the truth of this assert he appealed, laughing, to a parti of men who were drink in the room. the men, however, took part with corkscrew, and, draw him over to their table, made him sit down with them. they were in high good-humour, and the butler soon grew so intim with them, that, in the open of his heart, he soon communic to them, not onli all his own affairs, but all that he knew, and more than all that he knew, of his mistress'. his new friend were by no mean uninterest by his conversation, and encourag him as much as possibl to talk; for they had secret views, which the butler was by no mean suffici sober to discover."
edgeworth,children,"mrs. churchil had some fine old famili plate; and these men belong to a gang of housebreakers. befor they part with corkscrew, they engag him to meet them again the next night; their intimaci was still more close cemented. one of the men actual offer to lend corkscrew three guinea toward the payment of his debt, and hint that, if he thought proper, he could easili get the whole clear off. upon this hint, corkscrew becam all attention, till, after some hesit on their part, and repeat promis of secreci on his, they at length disclos their plan to him. they gave him to understand, that if he would assist in let them into his mistress house, they would let him have an ampl share in the booty. the butler, who had the reput of be an honest man, and inde whose integr had hitherto been proof against everyth but"
edgeworth,children,"his mistress port, turn pale, and trembl at this proposal; drank two or three bumper to drown thought; and promis to give an answer the next day. he went home more than half-intoxicated. his mind was so full of what had passed, that he could not help brag to felix, whom he found awak at his return, that he could have his bill paid off at the alehous whenev he pleased; dropping, besides, some hints, which were not lost upon felix. in the morn felix remind him of the thing which he had said; and corkscrew, alarmed, endeavour to evad his questions, by say that he was not in his sens when he talk in that manner. nothing, however, that he could urg made ani impress upon felix, whose recollect on the subject was perfect distinct, and who had too much cun himself, and too littl confid in his companion,"
edgeworth,children,"to be the dupe of his dissimulation. the butler knew not what to do when he saw that felix was absolut determin either to betray their scheme, or to becom a sharer in the booty. the next night came, and he was now to make a final decision; either to determin on break off entir with his new acquaintances, or take felix with him to join in the plot. his debt, his love of drinking, the imposs of indulg it without a fresh suppli of money, all came into his mind at once, and conquer his remain scruples. it is said by those whose fatal experi give them a right to be believed, that a drunkard will sacrific anything, everything, sooner than the pleasur of habitu intoxication. how much easier is it never to begin a bad custom than to break through it when onc formed! the hour of rendezv"
edgeworth,children,"came, and corkscrew went to the alehouse, where he found the housebreak wait for him, and a glass of brandi readi pour out. he sighed--drank--hesitated--drank again--heard the landlord talk of his bill, saw the money produc which would pay it in a moment-- drank again--curs himself, and, give his hand to the villain who was whisper in his ear, swore that he could not help it, and must do as they would have him. they requir of him to give up the key of the hous door, that they might get anoth made by it. he had left it with felix, and was now oblig to explain the new difficulti which had arisen. felix knew enough to ruin them, and must therefor be won over. this was no veri difficult task; he had a strong desir to have some work cravats, and the butler knew enough of him to believ"
edgeworth,children,"that this would be a suffici bribe. the cravat were bought and shown to felix. he thought them the onli thing want to make him a complete, fine gentleman; and to go without them, especi when he had onc seen himself in the glass with one tie on in a splendid bow, appear impossible. even this paltri temptation, work upon his vanity, at length prevail with a boy whose integr had long been corrupt by the habit of petti pilfer and daili falsehood. it was agre that, the first time his mistress sent him out on a message, he should carri the key of the hous door to his cousin's, and deliv it into the hand of one of the gang, who were there in wait for it. such was the scheme. felix, the night after all this had been planned, went to bed, and fell fast asleep; but the"
edgeworth,children,"butler, who had not yet stifl the voic of conscience, felt, in the silenc of the night, so insupport miserable, that, instead of go to rest, he stole soft into the pantri for a bottl of his mistress wine, and there drink glass after glass, he stay till he becam so far intoxicated, that, though he contriv to find his way back to bed, he could by no mean undress himself. without ani power of recollection, he flung himself upon the bed, leav his candl half hang out of the candlestick besid him. franklin slept in the next room to him, and present awaking, thought he perceiv a strong smell of someth burning. he jump up, and see a light under the butler door, gentl open it, and to his astonishment, beheld one of the bed curtain in flames. he immedi ran to the butler, and pull him with all"
edgeworth,children,"his force, to rous him from his lethargy. he came to his sens at length, but was so terrified, and so helpless, that, if it had not been for franklin, the whole hous would soon inevit have been on fire. felix, trembl and cowardly, knew not what to do; and it was curious to see him obey franklin, whose turn it now was to command. franklin ran upstair to awaken mrs. pomfret, whose terror of fire was so great that she came from her room almost out of her senses, whilst he, with the greatest presenc of mind, recollect where he had seen two larg tub of water, which the maid had prepar the night befor for their washing, and seiz the wet linen which had been left to soak, he threw them upon the flames. he exert himself with so much good sense, that the fire was present extinguished."
edgeworth,children,"everyth was now onc more safe and quiet. mrs. pomfret, recov from her fright, postpon all inquiri till the morning, and rejoic that her mistress had not been awakened, whilst corkscrew flatter himself that he should be abl to conceal the true caus of the accident. ""don't you tell mrs. pomfret where you found the candl when you came into the room,"" said he to franklin. ""if she ask me, you know i must tell the truth,"" repli he. ""must!"" repeat felix, sneeringly; ""what, you must be a tell-tale!"" ""no, i never told ani tale of anybody, and i should be veri sorri to get anyon into a scrape; but for all that i shall not tell a lie, either for myself or anybodi else, let you call me what name you will."" ""but if i were to give you someth that you would like,"" said corkscrew--""someth that i know"
edgeworth,children,"you would like!"" repeat felix. ""noth you can give me will do,"" answer franklin, steadily, ""so it is useless to say ani more about it--i hope i shall not be questioned."" in this hope he was mistaken; for the first thing mrs. pomfret did in the morn was to come into the room to examin and deplor the burnt curtains, whilst corkscrew stood by, endeavour to exculp himself by all the excus he could invent. mrs. pomfret, however, though sometim blind by her prejudices, was no fool; and it was absolut imposs to make her believ that a candle, which had been left on the hearth, where corkscrew protest he had left it, could have set curtain on fire which were at least six feet distant. turn short round to franklin, she desir that he would show her where he found the candl when he came into the room. he"
edgeworth,children,"took up the candlestick; but the moment the housekeep cast her eye upon it, she snatch it from his hands; ""how did this candlestick come here? this was not the candlestick you found here last night,"" cri she. ""yes, inde it was,"" answer franklin. ""that is impossible,"" retort she, vehemently, ""for i left this candlestick with my own hand last night, in the hall, the last thing i did, after you,"" said she, turn to the butler, ""was gone to bed--i'm sure of it--nay, don't you recollect my take this japan candlestick out of your hand, and make you to go up to bed with the brass one, and i bolt the door at the stair-head after you?"" this was all veri true; but corkscrew had afterward gone down from his room by a back staircase, unbolt that door, and, upon his return from the alehouse, had taken the japan"
edgeworth,children,"candlestick by mistak upstairs, and had left the brass one in it stead upon the hall table. ""oh, ma'am,"" said felix, ""inde you forget; for mr. corkscrew came into my room to desir me to call him betim in the morning, and i happen to take particular notice, and he had the japan candlestick in his hand, and that was just as i heard you, bolt the door. indeed, ma'am you forget."" ""indeed, sir,"" retort mrs. pomfret, rise in anger, ""i do not forget; i'm not come to be supperannu yet, i hope. how do you dare to tell me i forget?"" ""oh, ma'am,"" cri felix, ""i beg your pardon, i did not--i did not mean to say you forgot, but onli i thought, perhaps, you might not particular remember; for if you pleas to recollect--"" ""i won't pleas to recollect just whatev you please, sir! hold your tongue; whi"
edgeworth,children,"should you poke yourself into this scrape; what have you to do with it, i should be glad to know?"" ""noth in the world, oh noth in the world; i'm sure i beg your pardon, ma'am,"" answer felix, in a soft tone; and, sneak off, left his friend corkscrew to fight his own battle, secret resolv to desert in good time, if he saw ani danger of the alehous transact come to light. corkscrew could make but veri blunder excus for himself and, conscious of guilt, he turn pale, and appear so much more terrifi than butler usual appear when detect in a lie, that mrs. pomfret resolved, as she said, to sift the matter to the bottom. impati did she wait till the clock struck nine, and her mistress bell rang, the signal for her attend at her levee. ""how do you find yourself this morning, ma'am?"" said she,"
edgeworth,children,"undraw the curtains. ""veri sleepy, indeed,"" answer her mistress in a drowsi voice; ""i think i must sleep half an hour longer--shut the curtains."" ""as you please, ma'am; but i suppos i had better open a littl of the window shutter, for it past nine."" ""but just struck."" ""oh dear, ma'am, it struck befor i came upstairs, and you know we are twenti minut slow--lord bless us!"" exclaim mrs. pomfret, as she let fall the bar of the window, which rous her mistress. ""i'm sure i beg your pardon a thousand times--it onli the bar--becaus i had this great key in my hand."" ""put down the key, then, or you'll knock someth els down; and you may open the shutter now; for i'm quit awake."" ""dear me! i'm so sorri to think of disturb you,"" cri mrs. pomfret, at the same time throw the shutter wide open; ""but, to be"
edgeworth,children,"sure, ma'am, i have someth to tell you, which won't let you sleep again in a hurry. i brought up this here key of the hous door for reason of my own, which i'm sure you'll approv of; but i'm not come to that part of my stori yet. i hope you were not disturb by the nois in the hous last night, ma'am."" ""i heard no noise."" ""i am surpris at that, though,"" continu mrs. pomfret, and proceed to give a most ampl account of the fire, of her fears, and her suspicions. ""to be sure, ma'am, what i say is, that, without the spirit of prophecy, one can nowaday account for what has passed. i'm quit clear in my own judgment, that mr. corkscrew must have been out last night after i went to bed; for, besid the japan candlestick, which of itself i'm sure is strong enough"
edgeworth,children,"to hang a man, there anoth circumstance, ma'am, that certifi it to me--though i have not mention it, ma'am, to no one yet,"" lower her voice--""franklin, when i question him, told me, that he left the lantern in the outsid porch in the court last night, and this morn it was on the kitchen table. now, ma'am, that lantern could not come without hands; and i could not forget about that, you know; for franklin says, he sure he left the lantern out."" ""and do you believ him?"" inquir her mistress. ""to be sure, ma'am--how can i help believ him? i never found him out in the least symptom of a lie sinc ever he came into the house; so one can't help believ in him, like him or not."" ""without mean to tell a falsehood, however,"" said the lady, ""he might make a mistake."" ""no, ma'am, he never make"
edgeworth,children,"mistakes; it is not his way to go gossip and tattling; he never tell anyth till he asked, and then it fit he should. about the sirloin of beef, and all, he was right in the end, i found, to do him justice; and i'm sure he right now about the lantern--h alway right"" mrs. churchil could not help smiling. ""if you had seen him, ma'am, last night in the midst of the fire--i'm sure we may thank him that we were not burn aliv in our beds--and i shall never forget his come to call me. poor fellow! he that i was alway scold and scolding, enough to make him hate me. but he too good to hate anybody; and i'll be bound i'll make it up to him now."" ""take care that you don't go from one extrem into another, pomfret; don't spoil the boy."" ""no, ma'am, there"

""and so he shall be rewarded,"" said mrs. churchill; ""but i will tri him more fulli yet."" ""there no occasion, i think, for tri him ani more, ma'am,"" said mrs. pomfret, who was as violent in her like as in her dislikes. ""pray desire,"" continu her mistress, ""that he will bring up breakfast this morning; and leav the key of the house-door, pomfret, with me."" when franklin brought the urn into the breakfast-parlour, his mistress was stand by the fire with the key in her hand. she spoke to him of his last night exert in term of much approbation.

edgeworth,children,"was granted. franklin came into the kitchen just when all the servant had gather round the butler, who, with great importance, was read aloud the play- bill. everybodi present soon began to speak at once, and with great enthusiasm talk of the playhouse, the actors, and actresses; and then felix, in the first pause, turn to franklin, and said, ""lord, you know noth of all this! you never went to a play, did you?"" ""never,"" said franklin, and felt, he did not know why, a littl ashamed; and he long extrem to go to one. ""how should you like to go to the play with me to-morrow?"" said corkscrew. ""oh,"" exclaim franklin, ""i should like it exceedingly."" ""and do you think mistress would let you if i asked?"" ""i think mayb she would, if mrs. pomfret ask her."" ""but then you have no money, have you?"" ""no,"" said franklin, sighing."
edgeworth,children,"""but stay,"" said corkscrew, ""what i am think of is, that if mistress will let you go, i'll treat you myself, rather than that you should he disappointed."" delight, surpris and gratitud appear in franklin face at these words. corkscrew rejoic to see that now, at least, he had found a most power temptation. ""well then, i'll go just now and ask her. in the meantime, lend me the key of the hous door for a minut or two."" ""the key!"" answer franklin, starting; ""i'm sorry, but i can't do that, for i'v promis my mistress never to let it out of my own hands."" ""but how will she know anyth of the matter? run, run, and get it for us."" ""no, i cannot,"" repli franklin, resist the push which the butler gave his shoulder. ""you can't?"" cri corkscrew, chang his tone; ""then, sir, i can't take you to the"
edgeworth,children,"play."" ""veri well, sir,"" said franklin, sorrowfully, but with steadiness. ""veri well, sir,"" said felix, mimick him, ""you need not look so important, nor fanci yourself such a great man, becaus you'r master of a key."" ""say no more to him,"" interrupt corkscrew: ""let him alon to take his own way. felix, you would have no objection, i suppose, to go to the play with me?"" ""oh, i should like it of all things, if i did not come between anybodi else. but come, come!"" ad the hypocrite, assum a tone of friend persuasion, ""you won't be such a blockhead, franklin, as to lose go to the play for nothing; it onli just obstinacy. what harm can it do, to lend mr. corkscrew the key for five minutes? he'll give it to you back again safe and sound."" ""i don't doubt that,"" answer franklin. ""then it must be all becaus"
edgeworth,children,"you don't wish to oblig mr. corkscrew."" ""no, but i can't oblig him in this; for, as i told you before, my mistress trust me. i promis never to let the key out of my own hands, and you would not have me break my trust. mr. spencer told me that was wors than robbing."" at the word rob both corkscrew and felix involuntarili cast down their eyes, and turn the convers immediately, saying, that he did veri right; that they did not realli want the key, and had onli ask for it just to tri if he would keep his word.

edgeworth,children,"these thing considered, franklin resolv to take the key just as it was, with the wax stick to it, to his mistress. ""i was not mistaken when i thought i might trust you with this key,"" said mrs. churchill, after she had heard his story. ""mi brother will be here to-day, and i shall consult him. in the meantime, say noth of what has passed."" even came, and after tea mr. spencer sent for franklin upstairs.

""i don't think anything--much, i mean, of that, sir,"" answer franklin, smiling. ""are corkscrew and felix gone to the play?"" ""yes; half an hour ago, sir."" ""then i shall look into his room, and examin the pantri and the plate"

""you shall have both, indeed, mrs. pomfret; but don't make such a noise, for everybodi will hear you."" the love of mysteri was the onli thing which could have conquer mrs. pomfret love of talking. she was silent, and content herself the rest of the even with make signs, look ominous, and stalk about the hous like one possess with a secret. escap from mrs. pomfret fear and advice, mr. spencer went to a shop within a few door of the alehouse, which he heard corkscrew frequented, and sent to beg to speak to the landlord. he came; and, when mr."

melville,adventure,"by throw open the littl window toward the back of the entry, you at last come to the conclus that such an idea, howev wild, might not be altogeth unwarranted. but what most puzzl and confound you was a long, limber, portentous, black mass of someth hover in the centr of the pictur over three blue, dim, perpendicular line float in a nameless yeast. a boggy, soggy, squitchi pictur truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted. yet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimagin sublim about it that fair froze you to it, till you involuntarili took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvel paint meant. ever and anon a bright, but, alas, decept idea would dart you through.--it the black sea in a midnight gale.--it the unnatur combat of the four primal elements.--it a blast heath.--it a hyperborean winter scene.--it the breaking-up of the"
melville,adventure,"icebound stream of time. but at last all these fanci yield to that one portent someth in the pictur midst. that onc found out, and all the rest were plain. but stop; doe it not bear a faint resembl to a gigant fish? even the great leviathan himself? in fact, the artist design seem this: a final theori of my own, part base upon the aggreg opinion of mani age person with whom i convers upon the subject. the pictur repres a cape-horn in a great hurricane; the half-found ship welter there with it three dismantl mast alon visible; and an exasper whale, purpos to spring clean over the craft, is in the enorm act of impal himself upon the three mast-heads. the opposit wall of this entri was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous club and spears. some were thick set with glitter teeth resembl ivori"
melville,adventure,"saws; other were tuft with knot of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handl sweep round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-arm mower. you shudder as you gazed, and wonder what monstrous cannib and savag could ever have gone a death-harvest with such a hacking, horrifi implement. mix with these were rusti old whale lanc and harpoon all broken and deformed. some were stori weapons. with this onc long lance, now wild elbowed, fifti year ago did nathan swain kill fifteen whale between a sunris and a sunset. and that harpoon--so like a corkscrew now--wa flung in javan seas, and run away with by a whale, year afterward slain off the cape of blanco. the origin iron enter nigh the tail, and, like a restless needl sojourn in the bodi of a man, travel full forti feet, and at last was found"
melville,adventure,"imbed in the hump. cross this duski entry, and on through yon low-arch way--cut through what in old time must have been a great central chimney with fireplac all round--you enter the public room. a still duskier place is this, with such low ponder beam above, and such old wrinkl plank beneath, that you would almost fanci you trod some old craft cockpits, especi of such a howl night, when this corner-anchor old ark rock so furiously. on one side stood a long, low, shelf-lik tabl cover with crack glass cases, fill with dusti rariti gather from this wide world remotest nooks. project from the further angl of the room stand a dark-look den--th bar--a rude attempt at a right whale head. be that how it may, there stand the vast arch bone of the whale jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive beneath it. within are shabbi shelves,"
melville,adventure,"rang round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaw of swift destruction, like anoth curs jonah (bi which name inde they call him), bustl a littl wither old man, who, for their money, dear sell the sailor delirium and death. abomin are the tumbler into which he pour his poison. though true cylind without--within, the villan green goggl glass deceit taper downward to a cheat bottom. parallel meridian rude peck into the glass, surround these footpad goblets. fill to this mark, and your charg is but a penny; to this a penni more; and so on to the full glass--th cape horn measure, which you may gulp down for a shilling. upon enter the place i found a number of young seamen gather about a table, examin by a dim light diver specimen of skrimshander. i sought the landlord, and tell him i desir to be accommod with"
melville,adventure,"a room, receiv for answer that his hous was full--not a bed unoccupied. ""but avast,"" he added, tap his forehead, ""you haint no object to share a harpoon blanket, have ye? i s'pose you are goin a-whalin', so you'd better get use to that sort of thing."" i told him that i never like to sleep two in a bed; that if i should ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpoon might be, and that if he (the landlord) realli had no other place for me, and the harpoon was not decid objectionable, whi rather than wander further about a strang town on so bitter a night, i would put up with the half of ani decent man blanket. ""i thought so. all right; take a seat. supper?--you want supper? supper'l be readi directly."" i sat down on an old wooden settle, carv all over like a"
melville,adventure,"bench on the battery. at one end a rumin tar was still further adorn it with his jack-knife, stoop over and dilig work away at the space between his legs. he was tri his hand at a ship under full sail, but he didn't make much headway, i thought. at last some four or five of us were summon to our meal in an adjoin room. it was cold as iceland--no fire at all--th landlord said he couldn't afford it. noth but two dismal tallow candles, each in a wind sheet. we were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold to our lip cup of scald tea with our half frozen fingers. but the fare was of the most substanti kind--not onli meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumpl for supper! one young fellow in a green box coat, address himself to these dumpl in a most"
melville,adventure,"dire manner. ""mi boy,"" said the landlord, ""you'll have the nightmar to a dead sartainty."" ""landlord,"" i whispered, ""that aint the harpoon is it?"" ""oh, no,"" said he, look a sort of diabol funny, ""the harpoon is a dark complexion chap. he never eat dumplings, he don't--h eat noth but steaks, and he like em rare."" ""the devil he does,"" say i. ""where is that harpooneer? is he here?"" ""he'll be here afor long,"" was the answer. i could not help it, but i began to feel suspici of this ""dark complexioned"" harpooneer. at ani rate, i made up my mind that if it so turn out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into bed befor i did. supper over, the compani went back to the bar-room, when, know not what els to do with myself, i resolv to spend the rest of the even as"
melville,adventure,"a looker on. present a riot nois was heard without. start up, the landlord cried, ""that the grampus crew. i seed her report in the of this morning; a three year voyage, and a full ship. hurrah, boys; now we'll have the latest news from the feegees."" a tramp of sea boot was heard in the entry; the door was flung open, and in roll a wild set of marin enough. envelop in their shaggi watch coats, and with their head muffl in woollen comforters, all bedarn and ragged, and their beard stiff with icicles, they seem an erupt of bear from labrador. they had just land from their boat, and this was the first hous they entered. no wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the whale mouth--th bar--when the wrinkl littl old jonah, there officiating, soon pour them out brimmer all round. one complain of a"
melville,adventure,"bad cold in his head, upon which jonah mix him a pitch-lik potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for all cold and catarrh whatsoever, never mind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of labrador, or on the weather side of an ice-island. the liquor soon mount into their heads, as it general doe even with the arrantest toper newli land from sea, and they began caper about most obstreperously. i observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though he seem desir not to spoil the hilar of his shipmat by his own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrain from make as much nois as the rest. this man interest me at once; and sinc the sea-god had ordain that he should soon becom my shipmat (though but a sleeping-partn one, so far as this narrat"
melville,adventure,"is concerned), i will here ventur upon a littl descript of him. he stood full six feet in height, with nobl shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. i have seldom seen such brawn in a man. his face was deepli brown and burnt, make his white teeth dazzl by the contrast; while in the deep shadow of his eye float some reminisc that did not seem to give him much joy. his voic at onc announc that he was a southerner, and from his fine stature, i thought he must be one of those tall mountain from the alleghanian ridg in virginia. when the revelri of his companion had mount to it height, this man slip away unobserved, and i saw no more of him till he becam my comrad on the sea. in a few minutes, however, he was miss by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for"
melville,adventure,"some reason a huge favourit with them, they rais a cri of ""bulkington! bulkington! where bulkington?"" and dart out of the hous in pursuit of him. it was now about nine o'clock, and the room seem almost supernatur quiet after these orgies, i began to congratul myself upon a littl plan that had occur to me just previous to the entranc of the seamen. no man prefer to sleep two in a bed. in fact, you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother. i don't know how it is, but peopl like to be privat when they are sleeping. and when it come to sleep with an unknown stranger, in a strang inn, in a strang town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your object indefinit multiply. nor was there ani earth reason whi i as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than"
melville,adventure,"anybodi else; for sailor no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor king do ashore. to be sure they all sleep togeth in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin. the more i ponder over this harpooneer, the more i abomin the thought of sleep with him. it was fair to presum that be a harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certain none of the finest. i began to twitch all over. besides, it was get late, and my decent harpoon ought to be home and go bedwards. suppos now, he should tumbl in upon me at midnight--how could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming? ""landlord! i'v chang my mind about that harpooneer.--i shan't sleep with him. i'll tri"
melville,adventure,"the bench here."" ""just as you please; i'm sorri i cant spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress, and it a plaguy rough board here""--feel of the knot and notches. ""but wait a bit, skrimshander; i'v got a carpent plane there in the bar--wait, i say, and i'll make ye snug enough."" so say he procur the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dust the bench, vigor set to plane away at my bed, the while grin like an ape. the shave flew right and left; till at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestruct knot. the landlord was near sprain his wrist, and i told him for heaven sake to quit--th bed was soft enough to suit me, and i did not know how all the plane in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. so gather up the shave with anoth grin,"
melville,adventure,"and throw them into the great stove in the middl of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a brown study. i now took the measur of the bench, and found that it was a foot too short; but that could be mend with a chair. but it was a foot too narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inch higher than the plane one--so there was no yoke them. i then place the first bench lengthwis along the onli clear space against the wall, leav a littl interv between, for my back to settl down in. but i soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especi as anoth current from the ricketi door met the one from the window, and"
melville,adventure,"both togeth form a seri of small whirlwind in the immedi vicin of the spot where i had thought to spend the night. the devil fetch that harpooneer, thought i, but stop, couldn't i steal a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be waken by the most violent knockings? it seem no bad idea; but upon second thought i dismiss it. for who could tell but what the next morning, so soon as i pop out of the room, the harpoon might be stand in the entry, all readi to knock me down! still, look round me again, and see no possibl chanc of spend a suffer night unless in some other person bed, i began to think that after all i might be cherish unwarrant prejudic against this unknown harpooneer. think i, i'll wait awhile; he must be drop in befor long."
melville,adventure,"i'll have a good look at him then, and perhap we may becom jolli good bedfellow after all--ther no telling. but though the other boarder kept come in by ones, twos, and threes, and go to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer. ""landlord! said i, ""what sort of a chap is he--do he alway keep such late hours?"" it was now hard upon twelv o'clock. the landlord chuckl again with his lean chuckle, and seem to be mightili tickl at someth beyond my comprehension. ""no,"" he answered, ""gener he an earli bird--airley to bed and airley to rise--yes, he the bird what catch the worm. but to-night he went out a peddling, you see, and i don't see what on airth keep him so late, unless, may be, he can't sell his head."" ""can't sell his head?--what sort of a bambooz stori is this you are tell me?"" get"
melville,adventure,"into a tower rage. ""do you pretend to say, landlord, that this harpoon is actual engag this bless saturday night, or rather sunday morning, in peddl his head around this town?"" ""that precis it,"" said the landlord, ""and i told him he couldn't sell it here, the market overstocked."" ""with what?"" shout i. ""with head to be sure; ain't there too mani head in the world?"" ""i tell you what it is, landlord,"" said i quit calmly, ""you'd better stop spin that yarn to me--i'm not green."" ""may be not,"" take out a stick and whittl a toothpick, ""but i rayther guess you'll be done brown if that ere harpoon hear you a slanderin his head."" ""i'll break it for him,"" said i, now fli into a passion again at this unaccount farrago of the landlord's. ""it broke a'ready,"" said he. ""broke,"" said i--""broke, do you mean?"" ""sartain, and that"
melville,adventure,"the veri reason he can't sell it, i guess."" ""landlord,"" said i, go up to him as cool as mt. hecla in a snow-storm--""landlord, stop whittling. you and i must understand one another, and that too without delay. i come to your hous and want a bed; you tell me you can onli give me half a one; that the other half belong to a certain harpooneer. and about this harpooneer, whom i have not yet seen, you persist in tell me the most mystifi and exasper stori tend to beget in me an uncomfort feel toward the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of connexion, landlord, which is an intim and confidenti one in the highest degree. i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpoon is, and whether i shall be in all respect safe to spend the night"
melville,adventure,"with him. and in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay that stori about sell his head, which if true i take to be good evid that this harpoon is stark mad, and i'v no idea of sleep with a madman; and you, sir, you i mean, landlord, you, sir, by tri to induc me to do so knowingly, would therebi render yourself liabl to a crimin prosecution."" ""wall,"" said the landlord, fetch a long breath, ""that a purti long sarmon for a chap that rip a littl now and then. but be easy, be easy, this here harpoon i have been tellin you of has just arriv from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of balm new zealand head (great curios, you know), and he sold all on em but one, and that one he tri to sell to-night, caus to-morrow sunday,"
melville,adventure,"and it would not do to be sellin human head about the street when folk is goin to churches. he want to, last sunday, but i stop him just as he was goin out of the door with four head strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions."" this account clear up the otherwis unaccount mystery, and show that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fool me--but at the same time what could i think of a harpoon who stay out of a saturday night clean into the holi sabbath, engag in such a cannib busi as sell the head of dead idolators? ""depend upon it, landlord, that harpoon is a danger man."" ""he pay reg'lar,"" was the rejoinder. ""but come, it get dread late, you had better be turn flukes--it a nice bed; sal and me slept in that ere bed"
melville,adventure,"the night we were spliced. there plenti of room for two to kick about in that bed; it an almighti big bed that. why, afor we give it up, sal use to put our sam and littl johnni in the foot of it. but i got a dream and sprawl about one night, and somehow, sam got pitch on the floor, and came near break his arm. arter that, sal said it wouldn't do. come along here, i'll give ye a glim in a jiffy;"" and so say he light a candl and held it toward me, offer to lead the way. but i stood irresolute; when look at a clock in the corner, he exclaim ""i vum it sunday--you won't see that harpoon to-night; he come to anchor somewhere--com along then; do come; won't ye come?"" i consid the matter a moment, and then up stair we went, and"
melville,adventure,"i was usher into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough, with a prodigi bed, almost big enough inde for ani four harpoon to sleep abreast. ""there,"" said the landlord, place the candl on a crazi old sea chest that did doubl duti as a wash-stand and centr table; ""there, make yourself comfort now, and good night to ye."" i turn round from eye the bed, but he had disappeared. fold back the counterpane, i stoop over the bed. though none of the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutini toler well. i then glanc round the room; and besid the bedstead and centr table, could see no other furnitur belong to the place, but a rude shelf, the four walls, and a paper fireboard repres a man strike a whale. of thing not proper belong to the room, there was a hammock lash up, and"
melville,adventure,"thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a larg seaman bag, contain the harpoon wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk. likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hook on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon stand at the head of the bed. but what is this on the chest? i took it up, and held it close to the light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tri everi way possibl to arriv at some satisfactori conclus concern it. i can compar it to noth but a larg door mat, ornament at the edg with littl tinkl tag someth like the stain porcupin quill round an indian moccasin. there was a hole or slit in the middl of this mat, as you see the same in south american ponchos. but could it be possibl that ani sober harpoon would get into"
melville,adventure,"a door mat, and parad the street of ani christian town in that sort of guise? i put it on, to tri it, and it weigh me down like a hamper, be uncommon shaggi and thick, and i thought a littl damp, as though this mysteri harpoon had been wear it of a raini day. i went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and i never saw such a sight in my life. i tore myself out of it in such a hurri that i gave myself a kink in the neck. i sat down on the side of the bed, and commenc think about this head-peddl harpooneer, and his door mat. after think some time on the bed-side, i got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in the middl of the room thinking. i then took off my coat,"
melville,adventure,"and thought a littl more in my shirt sleeves. but begin to feel veri cold now, half undress as i was, and rememb what the landlord said about the harpoon not come home at all that night, it be so veri late, i made no more ado, but jump out of my pantaloon and boots, and then blow out the light tumbl into bed, and commend myself to the care of heaven. whether that mattress was stuf with corn-cob or broken crockery, there is no telling, but i roll about a good deal, and could not sleep for a long time. at last i slid off into a light doze, and had pretti near made a good of toward the land of nod, when i heard a heavi footfal in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door. lord save me, think"
melville,adventure,"i, that must be the harpooneer, the infern head-peddler. but i lay perfect still, and resolv not to say a word till spoken to. hold a light in one hand, and that ident new zealand head in the other, the stranger enter the room, and without look toward the bed, place his candl a good way off from me on the floor in one corner, and then began work away at the knot cord of the larg bag i befor spoke of as be in the room. i was all eager to see his face, but he kept it avert for some time while employ in unlac the bag mouth. this accomplished, however, he turn round--when, good heavens! what a sight! such a face! it was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with larg blackish look squares. yes, it just as i thought, he a"
melville,adventure,"terribl bedfellow; he been in a fight, got dread cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. but at that moment he chanc to turn his face so toward the light, that i plain saw they could not be sticking-plast at all, those black squar on his cheeks. they were stain of some sort or other. at first i knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkl of the truth occur to me. i rememb a stori of a white man--a whaleman too--who, fall among the cannibals, had been tattoo by them. i conclud that this harpooneer, in the cours of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. and what is it, thought i, after all! it onli his outside; a man can be honest in ani sort of skin. but then, what to make of his unearth complexion, that part of it,"
melville,adventure,"i mean, lie round about, and complet independ of the squar of tattooing. to be sure, it might be noth but a good coat of tropic tanning; but i never heard of a hot sun tan a white man into a purplish yellow one. however, i had never been in the south seas; and perhap the sun there produc these extraordinari effect upon the skin. now, while all these idea were pass through me like lightning, this harpoon never notic me at all. but, after some difficulti have open his bag, he commenc fumbl in it, and present pull out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. place these on the old chest in the middl of the room, he then took the new zealand head--a ghast thing enough--and cram it down into the bag. he now took off his hat--a new beaver hat--when i"
melville,adventure,"came nigh sing out with fresh surprise. there was no hair on his head--non to speak of at least--noth but a small scalp-knot twist up on his forehead. his bald purplish head now look for all the world like a mildew skull. had not the stranger stood between me and the door, i would have bolt out of it quicker than ever i bolt a dinner. even as it was, i thought someth of slip out of the window, but it was the second floor back. i am no coward, but what to make of this head-peddl purpl rascal altogeth pass my comprehension. ignor is the parent of fear, and be complet nonpluss and confound about the stranger, i confess i was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night. in fact, i"
melville,adventure,"was so afraid of him that i was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactori answer concern what seem inexplic in him. meanwhile, he continu the busi of undressing, and at last show his chest and arms. as i live, these cover part of him were checker with the same squar as his face; his back, too, was all over the same dark squares; he seem to have been in a thirti year war, and just escap from it with a sticking-plast shirt. still more, his veri leg were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frog were run up the trunk of young palms. it was now quit plain that he must be some abomin savag or other ship aboard of a whaleman in the south seas, and so land in this christian country. i quak to think of it. a peddler of"
melville,adventure,"head too--perhap the head of his own brothers. he might take a fanci to mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk! but there was no time for shuddering, for now the savag went about someth that complet fascin my attention, and convinc me that he must inde be a heathen. go to his heavi grego, or wrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previous hung on a chair, he fumbl in the pockets, and produc at length a curious littl deform imag with a hunch on it back, and exact the colour of a three day old congo baby. rememb the embalm head, at first i almost thought that this black manikin was a real babi preserv in some similar manner. but see that it was not at all limber, and that it glisten a good deal like polish ebony, i conclud that it must be noth but a wooden idol, which inde"
melville,adventure,"it prove to be. for now the savag goe up to the empti fire-place, and remov the paper fire-board, set up this littl hunch-back image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. the chimney jamb and all the brick insid were veri sooty, so that i thought this fire-plac made a veri appropri littl shrine or chapel for his congo idol. i now screw my eye hard toward the half hidden image, feel but ill at eas meantime--to see what was next to follow. first he take about a doubl hand of shave out of his grego pocket, and place them care befor the idol; then lay a bit of ship biscuit on top and appli the flame from the lamp, he kindl the shave into a sacrifici blaze. presently, after mani hasti snatch into the fire, and still hastier withdraw of his finger (wherebi he seem to be scorch them"
melville,adventure,"badly), he at last succeed in draw out the biscuit; then blow off the heat and ash a little, he made a polit offer of it to the littl negro. but the littl devil did not seem to fanci such dri sort of fare at all; he never move his lips. all these strang antic were accompani by still stranger guttur nois from the devotee, who seem to be pray in a sing-song or els sing some pagan psalmodi or other, dure which his face twitch about in the most unnatur manner. at last extinguish the fire, he took the idol up veri unceremoniously, and bag it again in his grego pocket as careless as if he were a sportsman bag a dead woodcock. all these queer proceed increas my uncomfortableness, and see him now exhibit strong symptom of conclud his busi operations, and jump into bed with me, i"
melville,adventure,"thought it was high time, now or never, befor the light was put out, to break the spell in which i had so long been bound. but the interv i spent in deliber what to say, was a fatal one. take up his tomahawk from the table, he examin the head of it for an instant, and then hold it to the light, with his mouth at the handle, he puf out great cloud of tobacco smoke. the next moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. i sang out, i could not help it now; and give a sudden grunt of astonish he began feel me. stammer out something, i knew not what, i roll away from him against the wall, and then conjur him, whoever or whatev he might be, to keep quiet, and let me get up"
melville,adventure,"and light the lamp again. but his guttur respons satisfi me at onc that he but ill comprehend my meaning. ""who-e debel you?""--h at last said--""you no speak-e, dam-me, i kill-e."" and so say the light tomahawk began flourish about me in the dark. ""landlord, for god sake, peter coffin!"" shout i. ""landlord! watch! coffin! angels! save me!"" ""speak-e! tell-e me who-e be, or dam-me, i kill-e!"" again growl the cannibal, while his horrid flourish of the tomahawk scatter the hot tobacco ash about me till i thought my linen would get on fire. but thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand, and leap from the bed i ran up to him. ""don't be afraid now,"" said he, grin again, ""queequeg here wouldn't harm a hair of your head."" ""stop your grinning,"" shout i, ""and whi didn't you tell me that that infern"
melville,adventure,"harpoon was a cannibal?"" ""i thought ye know'd it;--didn't i tell ye, he was a peddlin head around town?--but turn fluke again and go to sleep. queequeg, look here--you sabbe me, i sabbee--you this man sleep you--you sabbee?"" ""me sabbe plenty""--grunt queequeg, puf away at his pipe and sit up in bed. ""you gette in,"" he added, motion to me with his tomahawk, and throw the cloth to one side. he realli did this in not onli a civil but a realli kind and charit way. i stood look at him a moment. for all his tattoo he was on the whole a clean, come look cannibal. what all this fuss i have been make about, thought i to myself--th man a human be just as i am: he has just as much reason to fear me, as i have to be afraid of him. better sleep with a sober"

""landlord,"" said i, ""tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatev you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and i will turn in with him. but i don't fanci have a man smoke in bed with me. it dangerous. besides, i ain't insured."" this be told to queequeg, he at onc complied, and again polit motion me to get into bed--rol over to one side as much as to say--i won't touch a leg of ye."" ""good night, landlord,"" said i, ""you may go."" i turn in, and never slept better in my life. chapter 4 the counterpane. upon wake next morn about daylight, i found queequeg arm thrown over me in the most love and affection manner. you had almost thought i had been his wife. the counterpan was of patchwork, full of odd littl parti-colour squar and"
melville,adventure,"triangles; and this arm of his tattoo all over with an intermin cretan labyrinth of a figure, no two part of which were of one precis shade--ow i suppos to his keep his arm at sea unmethod in sun and shade, his shirt sleev irregular roll up at various times--thi same arm of his, i say, look for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt. indeed, part lie on it as the arm did when i first awoke, i could hard tell it from the quilt, they so blend their hue together; and it was onli by the sens of weight and pressur that i could tell that queequeg was hug me. my sensat were strange. let me tri to explain them. when i was a child, i well rememb a somewhat similar circumst that befel me; whether it was a realiti or a dream, i"
melville,adventure,"never could entir settle. the circumst was this. i had been cut up some caper or other--i think it was tri to crawl up the chimney, as i had seen a littl sweep do a few day previous; and my stepmoth who, somehow or other, was all the time whip me, or send me to bed supperless,--mi mother drag me by the leg out of the chimney and pack me off to bed, though it was onli two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st june, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. i felt dreadfully. but there was no help for it, so up stair i went to my littl room in the third floor, undress myself as slowli as possibl so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets. i lay there dismal calcul that sixteen entir hour must elaps befor"
melville,adventure,"i could hope for a resurrection. sixteen hour in bed! the small of my back ach to think of it. and it was so light too; the sun shine in at the window, and a great rattl of coach in the streets, and the sound of gay voic all over the house. i felt wors and worse--at last i got up, dressed, and soft go down in my stocking feet, sought out my stepmother, and sudden threw myself at her feet, beseech her as a particular favour to give me a good slipper for my misbehaviour; anyth inde but condemn me to lie abe such an unendur length of time. but she was the best and most conscienti of stepmothers, and back i had to go to my room. for sever hour i lay there broad awake, feel a great deal wors than i have ever done since, even from"
melville,adventure,"the greatest subsequ misfortunes. at last i must have fallen into a troubl nightmar of a doze; and slowli wake from it--half steep in dreams--i open my eyes, and the befor sun-lit room was now wrap in outer darkness. instant i felt a shock run through all my frame; noth was to be seen, and noth was to be heard; but a supernatur hand seem place in mine. my arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seem close seat by my bed-side. for what seem age pile on ages, i lay there, frozen with the most aw fears, not dare to drag away my hand; yet ever think that if i could but stir it one singl inch, the horrid spell would be broken. i knew not how this conscious at last glide away from me; but wake in"
melville,adventure,"the morning, i shudder rememb it all, and for day and week and month afterward i lost myself in confound attempt to explain the mystery. nay, to this veri hour, i often puzzl myself with it. now, take away the aw fear, and my sensat at feel the supernatur hand in mine were veri similar, in their strangeness, to those which i experienc on wake up and see queequeg pagan arm thrown round me. but at length all the past night event sober recurred, one by one, in fix reality, and then i lay onli aliv to the comic predicament. for though i tri to move his arm--unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleep as he was, he still hug me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain. i now strove to rous him--""queequeg!""--but his onli answer was a snore. i then roll over, my neck feel as if"
melville,adventure,"it were in a horse-collar; and sudden felt a slight scratch. throw asid the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleep by the savag side, as if it were a hatchet-fac baby. a pretti pickle, truly, thought i; abe here in a strang hous in the broad day, with a cannib and a tomahawk! ""queequeg!--in the name of goodness, queequeg, wake!"" at length, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incess expostul upon the unbecoming of his hug a fellow male in that matrimoni sort of style, i succeed in extract a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a pike-staff, look at me, and rub his eye as if he did not altogeth rememb how i came to be there, though a dim conscious of know someth about me"
melville,adventure,"seem slowli dawn over him. meanwhile, i lay quiet eye him, have no serious misgiv now, and bent upon narrowli observ so curious a creature. when, at last, his mind seem made up touch the charact of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconcil to the fact; he jump out upon the floor, and by certain sign and sound gave me to understand that, if it pleas me, he would dress first and then leav me to dress afterwards, leav the whole apart to myself. think i, queequeg, under the circumstances, this is a veri civil overture; but, the truth is, these savag have an innat sens of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvel how essenti polit they are. i pay this particular compliment to queequeg, becaus he treat me with so much civil and consideration, while i was guilti of great rudeness; stare at him"
melville,adventure,"from the bed, and watch all his toilett motions; for the time my curios get the better of my breeding. nevertheless, a man like queequeg you don't see everi day, he and his way were well worth unusu regarding. he commenc dress at top by don his beaver hat, a veri tall one, by the by, and then--stil minus his trowsers--h hunt up his boots. what under the heaven he did it for, i cannot tell, but his next movement was to crush himself--boot in hand, and hat on--und the bed; when, from sundri violent gasp and strainings, i infer he was hard at work boot himself; though by no law of proprieti that i ever heard of, is ani man requir to be privat when put on his boots. but queequeg, do you see, was a creatur in the transit stage--neith caterpillar nor butterfly. he was just enough civil"
melville,adventure,"to show off his outlandish in the strangest possibl manners. his educ was not yet completed. he was an undergraduate. if he had not been a small degre civilized, he veri probabl would not have troubl himself with boot at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of get under the bed to put them on. at last, he emerg with his hat veri much dent and crush down over his eyes, and began creak and limp about the room, as if, not be much accustom to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkl cowhid ones--prob not made to order either--rath pinch and torment him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning. seeing, now, that there were no curtain to the window, and that the street be veri narrow, the hous opposit command a plain view into the room,"
melville,adventure,"and observ more and more the indecor figur that queequeg made, stave about with littl els but his hat and boot on; i beg him as well as i could, to acceler his toilet somewhat, and particular to get into his pantaloon as soon as possible. he complied, and then proceed to wash himself. at that time in the morn ani christian would have wash his face; but queequeg, to my amazement, content himself with restrict his ablut to his chest, arms, and hands. he then don his waistcoat, and take up a piec of hard soap on the wash-stand centr table, dip it into water and commenc lather his face. i was watch to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he take the harpoon from the bed corner, slip out the long wooden stock, unsheath the head, whet it a littl on his boot, and"
melville,adventure,"stride up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begin a vigor scraping, or rather harpoon of his cheeks. think i, queequeg, this is use roger best cutleri with a vengeance. afterward i wonder the less at this oper when i came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceed sharp the long straight edg are alway kept. the rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proud march out of the room, wrap up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sport his harpoon like a marshal baton. chapter 5 breakfast. i quick follow suit, and descend into the bar-room accost the grin landlord veri pleasantly. i cherish no malic toward him, though he had been skylark with me not a littl in the matter of my bedfellow. however, a good laugh is a mighti good thing, and rather"
melville,adventure,"too scarc a good thing; the more the pity. so, if ani one man, in his own proper person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be backward, but let him cheer allow himself to spend and be spent in that way. and the man that has anyth bounti laughabl about him, be sure there is more in that man than you perhap think for. the bar-room was now full of the boarder who had been drop in the night previous, and whom i had not as yet had a good look at. they were near all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawni company, with boski beards; an unshorn, shaggi set, all wear monkey jacket for morn gowns. you could pretti plain tell how long"
melville,adventure,"each one had been ashore. this young fellow healthi cheek is like a sun-toast pear in hue, and would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three day land from his indian voyage. that man next him look a few shade lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. in the complexion of a third still linger a tropic tawn, but slight bleach withal; he doubtless has tarri whole week ashore. but who could show a cheek like queequeg? which, bar with various tints, seem like the and western slope, to show forth in one array, contrast climates, zone by zone. ""grub, ho!"" now cri the landlord, fling open a door, and in we went to breakfast. they say that men who have seen the world, therebi becom quit at eas in manner, quit self-possess in company. not always, though: ledyard, the great"
melville,adventure,"new england traveller, and mungo park, the scotch one; of all men, they possess the least assur in the parlor. but perhap the mere cross of siberia in a sledg drawn by dog as ledyard did, or the take a long solitari walk on an empti stomach, in the negro heart of africa, which was the sum of poor mungo performances--thi kind of travel, i say, may not be the veri best mode of attain a high social polish. still, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be had anywhere. these reflect just here are occas by the circumst that after we were all seat at the table, and i was prepar to hear some good stori about whaling; to my no small surprise, near everi man maintain a profound silence. and not onli that, but they look embarrassed. yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, mani"
melville,adventure,"of whom without the slightest bash had board great whale on the high seas--entir stranger to them--and duell them dead without winking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast table--al of the same calling, all of kindr tastes--look round as sheepish at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains. a curious sight; these bash bears, these timid warrior whalemen! but as for queequeg--why, queequeg sat there among them--at the head of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. to be sure i cannot say much for his breeding. his greatest admir could not have cordial justifi his bring his harpoon into breakfast with him, and use it there without ceremony; reach over the tabl with it, to the immin jeopardi of mani heads, and grappl the beefsteak toward him. but that was certain"
melville,adventure,"veri coolli done by him, and everi one know that in most peopl estimation, to do anyth coolli is to do it genteelly. we will not speak of all queequeg peculiar here; how he eschew coffe and hot rolls, and appli his undivid attent to beefsteaks, done rare. enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room, light his tomahawk-pipe, and was sit there quiet digest and smoke with his insepar hat on, when i salli out for a stroll. chapter 6 the street. if i had been astonish at first catch a glimps of so outlandish an individu as queequeg circul among the polit societi of a civil town, that astonish soon depart upon take my first daylight stroll through the street of new bedford. in thoroughfar nigh the docks, ani consider seaport will frequent offer to view the queerest look nondescript from"
melville,adventure,"foreign parts. even in broadway and chestnut streets, mediterranean marin will sometim jostl the affright ladies. regent street is not unknown to lascar and malays; and at bombay, in the apollo green, live yanke have often scare the natives. but new bedford beat all water street and wapping. in these last-ment haunt you see onli sailors; but in new bedford, actual cannib stand chat at street corners; savag outright; mani of whom yet carri on their bone unholi flesh. it make a stranger stare. but, besid the feegeeans, tongatobooarrs, erromanggoans, pannangians, and brighggians, and, besid the wild specimen of the whaling-craft which unheed reel about the streets, you will see other sight still more curious, certain more comical. there week arriv in this town score of green vermont and new hampshir men, all athirst for gain and glori in the fishery. they are most young, of stalwart frames; fellow who"
melville,adventure,"have fell forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance. mani are as green as the green mountain whenc they came. in some thing you would think them but a few hour old. look there! that chap strut round the corner. he wear a beaver hat and swallow-tail coat, girdl with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife. here come anoth with a sou'-west and a bombazin cloak. no town-br dandi will compar with a country-br one--i mean a downright bumpkin dandy--a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his two acr in buckskin glove for fear of tan his hands. now when a countri dandi like this take it into his head to make a distinguish reputation, and join the great whale-fishery, you should see the comic thing he doe upon reach the seaport. in bespeak his sea-outfit, he order bell-button to his waistcoats; strap to his canva"
melville,adventure,"trowsers. ah, poor hay-seed! how bitter will burst those strap in the first howl gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest. but think not that this famous town has onli harpooneers, cannibals, and bumpkin to show her visitors. not at all. still new bedford is a queer place. had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this day perhap have been in as howl condit as the coast of labrador. as it is, part of her back countri are enough to frighten one, they look so bony. the town itself is perhap the dearest place to live in, in all new england. it is a land of oil, true enough: but not like canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. the street do not run with milk; nor in the spring-tim do they pave them with fresh"
melville,adventure,"eggs. yet, in spite of this, nowher in all america will you find more patrician-lik houses; park and garden more opulent, than in new bedford. whenc came they? how plant upon this onc scraggi scoria of a country? go and gaze upon the iron emblemat harpoon round yonder lofti mansion, and your question will be answered. yes; all these brave hous and floweri garden came from the atlantic, pacific, and indian oceans. one and all, they were harpoon and drag up hither from the bottom of the sea. can herr alexand perform a feat like that? in new bedford, fathers, they say, give whale for dower to their daughters, and portion off their niec with a few porpois a-piece. you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they have reservoir of oil in everi house, and everi night reckless burn their length in spermaceti"
melville,adventure,"candles. in summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples--long avenu of green and gold. and in august, high in air, the beauti and bounti horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-bi their taper upright cone of congreg blossoms. so omnipot is art; which in mani a district of new bedford has superinduc bright terrac of flower upon the barren refus rock thrown asid at creation final day. and the women of new bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. but rose onli bloom in summer; wherea the fine carnat of their cheek is perenni as sunlight in the seventh heavens. elsewher match that bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in salem, where they tell me the young girl breath such musk, their sailor sweetheart smell them mile off shore, as though they were draw nigh the odor molucca instead of the puritan sands. chapter 7 the"
melville,adventure,"chapel. in this same new bedford there stand a whaleman chapel, and few are the moodi fishermen, short bound for the indian ocean or pacific, who fail to make a sunday visit to the spot. i am sure that i did not. return from my first morn stroll, i again salli out upon this special errand. the sky had chang from clear, sunni cold, to drive sleet and mist. wrap myself in my shaggi jacket of the cloth call bearskin, i fought my way against the stubborn storm. entering, i found a small scatter congreg of sailors, and sailor wive and widows. a muffl silenc reigned, onli broken at time by the shriek of the storm. each silent worshipp seem purpos sit apart from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable. the chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these silent island of men and women"
melville,adventure,"sat steadfast eye sever marbl tablets, with black borders, mason into the wall on either side the pulpit. three of them ran someth like the following, but i do not pretend to quote:-- sacr to the memori of john talbot, who, at the age of eighteen, was lost overboard, near the isl of desolation, off patagonia, novemb 1st, 1836. this tablet is erect to his memori by his sister. _____________ sacr to the memori of robert long, willi ellery, nathan coleman, walter canny, seth macy, and samuel gleig, form one of the boat crew of the ship eliza who were tow out of sight by a whale, on the off-shor ground in the pacific, decemb 31st, 1839. this marbl is here place by their surviv shipmates. _____________ sacr to the memori of the late captain ezekiel hardy, who in the bow of his boat was kill by a sperm whale"
melville,adventure,"on the coast of japan, august 3d, 1833. this tablet is erect to his memori by his widow. shake off the sleet from my ice-glaz hat and jacket, i seat myself near the door, and turn sideway was surpris to see queequeg near me. affect by the solemn of the scene, there was a wonder gaze of incredul curios in his countenance. this savag was the onli person present who seem to notic my entrance; becaus he was the onli one who could not read, and, therefore, was not read those frigid inscript on the wall. whether ani of the relat of the seamen whose name appear there were now among the congregation, i knew not; but so mani are the unrecord accid in the fishery, and so plain did sever women present wear the counten if not the trap of some unceas grief, that i feel sure that here"
melville,adventure,"befor me were assembl those, in whose unheal heart the sight of those bleak tablet sympathet caus the old wound to bleed afresh. oh! ye whose dead lie buri beneath the green grass; who stand among flower can say--here, here lie my beloved; ye know not the desol that brood in bosom like these. what bitter blank in those black-bord marbl which cover no ashes! what despair in those immov inscriptions! what dead void and unbidden infidel in the line that seem to gnaw upon all faith, and refus resurrect to the be who have placeless perish without a grave. as well might those tablet stand in the cave of elephanta as here. in what census of live creatures, the dead of mankind are included; whi it is that a univers proverb say of them, that they tell no tales, though contain more secret than the goodwin sands; how it"
melville,adventure,"is that to his name who yesterday depart for the other world, we prefix so signific and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitl him, if he but embark for the remotest indi of this live earth; whi the life insur compani pay death-forfeitur upon immortals; in what eternal, unstir paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lie antiqu adam who die sixti round centuri ago; how it is that we still refus to be comfort for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwell in unspeak bliss; whi all the live so strive to hush all the dead; wherefor but the rumor of a knock in a tomb will terrifi a whole city. all these thing are not without their meanings. but faith, like a jackal, feed among the tombs, and even from these dead doubt she gather her most vital hope. it need scarc to be told, with"
melville,adventure,"what feelings, on the eve of a nantucket voyage, i regard those marbl tablets, and by the murki light of that darkened, dole day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone befor me. yes, ishmael, the same fate may be thine. but somehow i grew merri again. delight induc to embark, fine chanc for promotion, it seems--aye, a stove boat will make me an immort by brevet. yes, there is death in this busi of whaling--a speechless quick chaotic bundl of a man into eternity. but what then? methink we have huge mistaken this matter of life and death. methink that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance. methink that in look at thing spiritual, we are too much like oyster observ the sun through the water, and think that thick water the thinnest of air. methink my bodi is but the lee"
melville,adventure,"of my better being. in fact take my bodi who will, take it i say, it is not me. and therefor three cheer for nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove bodi when they will, for stave my soul, jove himself cannot. chapter 8 the pulpit. i had not been seat veri long ere a man of a certain vener robust entered; immedi as the storm-pelt door flew back upon admit him, a quick regard eye of him by all the congregation, suffici attest that this fine old man was the chaplain. yes, it was the famous father mapple, so call by the whalemen, among whom he was a veri great favourite. he had been a sailor and a harpoon in his youth, but for mani year past had dedic his life to the ministry. at the time i now write of, father mappl was in the hardi winter"
melville,adventure,"of a healthi old age; that sort of old age which seem merg into a second flower youth, for among all the fissur of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleam of a newli develop bloom--th spring verdur peep forth even beneath februari snow. no one have previous heard his history, could for the first time behold father mappl without the utmost interest, becaus there were certain engraft cleric peculiar about him, imput to that adventur maritim life he had led. when he enter i observ that he carri no umbrella, and certain had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melt sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seem almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed. however, hat and coat and oversho were one by one removed, and hung up in a littl space in"
melville,adventure,"an adjac corner; when, array in a decent suit, he quiet approach the pulpit. like most old fashion pulpits, it was a veri lofti one, and sinc a regular stair to such a height would, by it long angl with the floor, serious contract the alreadi small area of the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had act upon the hint of father mapple, and finish the pulpit without a stairs, substitut a perpendicular side ladder, like those use in mount a ship from a boat at sea. the wife of a whale captain had provid the chapel with a handsom pair of red worst man-rop for this ladder, which, be itself nice headed, and stain with a mahogani colour, the whole contrivance, consid what manner of chapel it was, seem by no mean in bad taste. halt for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both hand"
melville,adventure,"grasp the ornament knob of the man-ropes, father mappl cast a look upwards, and then with a truli sailor-lik but still reverenti dexterity, hand over hand, mount the step as if ascend the main-top of his vessel. the perpendicular part of this side ladder, as is usual the case with swing ones, were of cloth-cov rope, onli the round were of wood, so that at everi step there was a joint. at my first glimps of the pulpit, it had not escap me that howev conveni for a ship, these joint in the present instanc seem unnecessary. for i was not prepar to see father mappl after gain the height, slowli turn round, and stoop over the pulpit, deliber drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposit within, leav him impregn in his littl quebec. i ponder some time without fulli comprehend the reason for this."
melville,adventure,"father mappl enjoy such a wide reput for sincer and sanctity, that i could not suspect him of court notorieti by ani mere trick of the stage. no, thought i, there must be some sober reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbol someth unseen. can it be, then, that by that act of physic isolation, he signifi his spiritu withdraw for the time, from all outward world tie and connexions? yes, for replenish with the meat and wine of the word, to the faith man of god, this pulpit, i see, is a self-contain stronghold--a lofti ehrenbreitstein, with a perenni well of water within the walls. but the side ladder was not the onli strang featur of the place, borrow from the chaplain former sea-farings. between the marbl cenotaph on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which form it back was adorn with a larg paint repres a"
melville,adventure,"gallant ship beat against a terribl storm off a lee coast of black rock and snowi breakers. but high abov the fli scud and dark-rol clouds, there float a littl isl of sunlight, from which beam forth an angel face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radianc upon the ship toss deck, someth like that silver plate now insert into the victori plank where nelson fell. ""ah, nobl ship,"" the angel seem to say, ""beat on, beat on, thou nobl ship, and bear a hardi helm; for lo! the sun is break through; the cloud are roll off--serenest azur is at hand."" nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-tast that had achiev the ladder and the picture. it panel front was in the like of a ship bluff bows, and the holi bibl rest on a project piec of scroll work, fashion"
melville,adventure,"after a ship fiddle-head beak. what could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this earth foremost part; all the rest come in it rear; the pulpit lead the world. from thenc it is the storm of god quick wrath is first descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. from thenc it is the god of breez fair or foul is first invok for favour winds. yes, the world a ship on it passag out, and not a voyag complete; and the pulpit is it prow. chapter 9 the sermon. father mappl rose, and in a mild voic of unassum author order the scatter peopl to condense. ""starboard gangway, there! side away to larboard--larboard gangway to starboard! midships! midships!"" there was a low rumbl of heavi sea-boot among the benches, and a still slighter shuffl of women shoes, and all was quiet again, and everi eye"
melville,adventure,"on the preacher. he paus a little; then kneel in the pulpit bows, fold his larg brown hand across his chest, uplift his close eyes, and offer a prayer so deepli devout that he seem kneel and pray at the bottom of the sea. this ended, in prolong solemn tones, like the continu toll of a bell in a ship that is founder at sea in a fog--in such tone he commenc read the follow hymn; but chang his manner toward the conclud stanzas, burst forth with a peal exult and joy-- ""the rib and terror in the whale, arch over me a dismal gloom, while all god sun-lit wave roll by, and lift me deepen down to doom. ""i saw the open maw of hell, with endless pain and sorrow there; which none but they that feel can tell-- oh, i was plung to despair. ""in black distress, i"
melville,adventure,"call my god, when i could scarc believ him mine, he bow his ear to my complaints-- no more the whale did me confine. ""with speed he flew to my relief, as on a radiant dolphin borne; awful, yet bright, as lightn shone the face of my deliver god. ""mi song for ever shall record that terrible, that joy hour; i give the glori to my god, his all the merci and the power. near all join in sing this hymn, which swell high abov the howl of the storm. a brief paus ensued; the preacher slowli turn over the leav of the bible, and at last, fold his hand down upon the proper page, said: ""belov shipmates, clinch the last vers of the first chapter of jonah--'and god had prepar a great fish to swallow up jonah.'"" ""shipmates, this book, contain onli four chapters--four yarns--i one of the smallest"
melville,adventure,"strand in the mighti cabl of the scriptures. yet what depth of the soul doe jonah deep sealin sound! what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet! what a nobl thing is that canticl in the fish belly! how billow-lik and boister grand! we feel the flood surg over us; we sound with him to the kelpi bottom of the waters; sea-we and all the slime of the sea is about us! but what is this lesson that the book of jonah teaches? shipmates, it is a two-strand lesson; a lesson to us all as sin men, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the live god. as sin men, it is a lesson to us all, becaus it is a stori of the sin, hard-heartedness, sudden awaken fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and final the deliver and joy of jonah. as with all sinner among"
melville,adventure,"men, the sin of this son of amittai was in his wil disobedi of the command of god--nev mind now what that command was, or how conveyed--which he found a hard command. but all the thing that god would have us do are hard for us to do--rememb that--and hence, he often command us than endeavor to persuade. and if we obey god, we must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobey ourselves, wherein the hard of obey god consists.
